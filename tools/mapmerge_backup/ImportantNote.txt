This is a backup of Python mapmerge and Java mapmerge.
They are both considered outdated. For new version look at folder /tools/jmerge
These backups may eventually be outdated, when the new map merge tool is fully tested.

NOTE: If you want to use these, move them back to /tools folder locally, otherwise various scripts may not work correctly.
