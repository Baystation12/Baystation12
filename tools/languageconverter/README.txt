---USAGE---
[ENGLISH TO SHAGE]
First, find the word you want to translate in shage_3.html, via ctrl-F. 
Apply the grammar rules on the doc to get the correct IPA.
	EXAMPLE
	For example, if you wanted the word "shooter", well, that exact word doesn't
	exist. But we can make that word via grammar rules. 
	you would get the word for
	"shoot" (ħuˈʔos), and look at the derivational morphology section.
	Applying those rules, we would add ɛʔ to get ħuˈʔosɛʔ. Brackets mean
	that that character is only included if a vowel is required.
	Contact BlueNexus on discord if you need help in this regard.

Once you have your input text:
1. copy the IPA (the weird characters after the word)
2. Start up transliterator.py (You'll need python 3.x for that)
3. Paste in your IPA

If this is for SS13:
4. Copy the second line of output into your code editor
5. Done

If this is for anything else:
4. Install the included font
5. Open up a word editor and select the "Shage" font
6. Paste in the first line of transliterator output
7. Done

[SHAGE TO ENGLISH]
1. Start up detransliterator.py
2. Copy the shage letters
3. Paste them into the program, and press enter
4. Done
