<h1>Malfunctioning AI guide</h1><br>

This guide contains important OOC information for malfunctioning AIs.<br>

<h2>Goal</h2><br>
As a malfunctioning AI, your primary goal is to overtake the station's systems. To do this, research and use the software "Basic Encryption Hack" on APCs (right click on APC and select Basic Encryption Hack). Please note that hacked APCs have a distinctive blue error screen, which tends to attract unwanted attention. Remember that a malfunctioning AI is an antagonist, so read the server rules relating to  behavior expected from antagonists. Though activating the <b>System Override</b> is this antagonist type's coded OOC goal, feel free to create a custom goal as long as it is fun for everyone.<br>

<h2>Hardware</h2><br>
As a malfunctioning AI, you may select one hardware piece to help you. Remember that once you select hardware piece, you cannot select another one; choose wisely! Hardware may be selected by clicking "Select Hardware" button in the Hardware tab. The following is a list of possible hardware pieces:<br>
<b>APU Generator</b> - Auxiliary Power Unit which allows you to operate even without external power; however, activating and running the APU will stop your CPU time generation, and temporarily disable most of your abilities. APU is also somewhat vulnerable to physical damage, and will fail if your core hardware integrity drops below 50%.<br>
<b>Turrets Focus Enhancer</b> - Removes the safeties on installed turrets; this boosts their rate of fire, health, and enables them to regenerate a small amount of health over time should they be damaged. This increases power usage considerably, especially when regenerating damage.<br>
<b>Secondary Processor Unit</b> - A simple upgrade that increases your CPU time generation by 50%. Useful if you need to speed up your research.<br>
<b>Secondary Memory Bank</b> - Doubles the amount of maximal CPU time you may store. This is useful if you need to use lots of stacked abilities in short amount of time.<br>
<b>Self-Destruct Explosives</b> - Large blocks of C4 are attached to your physical core. This C4 has a 15 second timer, and may be activated by a special button that appears in your Hardware tab. This self-destruct will remain active, even if you are destroyed. If the timer reaches 0, your core will go up in a considerable explosion. Obviously, this destroys you along with as anyone nearby.<br>

<h2>Software</h2><br>
Software are abilities have to be unlocked via the research menu (Hardware tab). Unlocked abilities appear in the Software tab. <b>Sometimes, abilities won't appear in this tab after being researched. This can be fixed by logging out and reconnecting, or using the "ai-core" command.</b> Abilities are tiered: T1 are the weakest ones, while T4 are the strongest ones. To reach a higher tier, you must first research abilities in the lower tier. We currently have 11 abilities, in 3 research trees:<br>
<b>Networking</b> - Hacking-oriented abilities. T1 ability is the Basic Encryption Hack, which is necessary to hack more APCs and expand your reach. T2 allows for falsification of Central Command Messages, T3 allows you to change the station's alert level. <b>T4 ability is System Override -- it rapidly hacks all remaining APCs and, once complete, gives you access to station self destruct sequence.</b> This ability is technically the "end-game" of a Malfunctioning AI's bag of tricks, and using it will disable you from using any other software abilities until it is complete. The exact time varies depending on how many unhacked APCs remain on the station; since that time is usually measured in minutes, choose wisely when to activate it.<br>
<b>Interdiction</b> - Sabotage-oriented abilities. T1 ability allows you to recall the emergency shuttle. T2 allows you to unlock cyborgs even without access to a robotics console. T3 ability will allow you to remotely hack a cyborg, placing it under your control. T4 ability allows you to hack other AIs to slave them under your control.<br>
<b>Manipulation</b> - Physical-oriented abilities. <i>This research path will start on Tier 2, for now.</i> T2 ability allows you to apply upgrade of your choice to camera, or reactivate a broken camera. T3 ability allows you to create a weak forcefield that holds air, but it won't last for long. The T4 ability allows you to overload machines, detonating them in an explosion.<br>
