		Dr. Schoonhoven and I have been negotiating the routing we intended to take the SRV Verne for this expedition.<BR>\
		This matter was improperly discussed during the initial expedition planning, and I promise, we will be making amends upon our return to Tau-Ceti.\
		After your last shift, the executive decision was made to put the SRV Verne onto extended automation.<BR>\
		You will be alone during the initial day of your shift. <BR>\
		The routing Dr. Schoonhoven and I negotiated will take us further than ever before. This comes with consequences; I trust you will be careful during your Survey missions. <BR>\
		We will be making history with this expedition. You will have earned the honor of having chased the God of the Sun.<BR>\
		I have scheduled support staff to awake during the second day of your shift. They will be awake for 48 hours, to provide overlapping coverage to Survey Team Theta, after you have entered stasis.<BR>\
		Your scheduled support staff are;<BR>\
		Physician Dr. Milli Newman<BR>\
		Non-Essential Systems Technician Neel Barrett.<BR>\
		They will awake 24 hours after your shift begins.<BR>\
		Your shift will last for the standard 48 hours.<BR>\
		Your duties remain unchanged;<BR>\
		Survey the Exoplanet you have been brought to.<BR>\
		The students will be performing their studies as required.<BR>\
		If you feel any nearby sites are of value, you have my permission to divert to them.<BR>\
		Given our tenuous staffing, it comes with my highest recommendations that you are aware of any other active vessels in your system if they are amenable to working with you or to assist you if required. <BR>\
		I firmly request you do not touch the Supermatter Testing facilities, as I have scheduled later classes to awake to perform their studies using the stock we have remaining.<BR>\
		Our supplies remain at acceptable levels at this time, but I will permit barter or trading if required.\
		Do not sell the resources your fellow students will require.<BR>\
		I await your results.<BR>\
		Dr. Andre Richardson"
