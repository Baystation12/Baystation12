			<i>We received the latest batch of subjects this evening. Evening? Is it even evening? The schedule out here is so fucked in terms of sleep-cycles I forget to even check what time it is sometimes. I'm pretty sure it's evening anyway. Anyway, point is, we got the new guys, and thus far they seem like they fit the criteria pretty well. No family histories of diseases or the like, no current illnesses, prime physical condition, perfect subjects for our work. Tomorrow we start testing out the type 008 Serum. Hell if I know where this stuff's coming from, but it's fascinating. Injected into live subjects, it seems like it has a tendancy to not only cure them of ailments, but actually improve their bodily functions...</i>

			<i>I can't believe it, the type 8 Serum seems to actually have a regenerative effect on the subjects. We actually cut one's arm open during the test and ten minutes later, it had clotted. Fifteen and it was healing, and within two hours it was nothing but a fading scar. This is insanity, and the worst part is, we can't even determine HOW it does it yet. All these samples of the goo and not a damn clue how it works, it's infuriating! I'm going to try some additional tests with this stuff. I've heard it's got all kinds of uses, fuel enhancer, condiment, so on and so forth, even with this minty taste, but we'll see. There's got to be some rhyme or reason to this damned stuff.</i>

			<i>The samples of Type 8 we've got are almost out, but it seems like we're actually onto something major here. We'll need to get more sent over asap. This stuff may well be the key to immortality. We cut off one of the test subject's arms and they just put it back on and it healed in an hour or so to the point it was working fine. It's nothing short of miraculous.</i>

They haven't been moving right, and they seem distracted nearly constantly, and not in a normal way. They also look like they're turning kinda... green? One of the other guys says it's probably just a virus or something reacting with it, but I don't know, something seems off.</i>
