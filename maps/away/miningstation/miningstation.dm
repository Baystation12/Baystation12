			It's been quite some time since I've written.

Things are rough lately, we've had a lot of strange things going on, random equipment failures, random injuries, a few guys have even gotten sick. The docs don't know what's wrong with them but they're getting worse by the day. We're holding on while we can, the company wants us to stay out here until our cycle is over, which should be just over a few months.</i>

I'm sitting here in the power room, hoping they don't find me... If somehow, someone finds this, please... inform Lillian Mason that her husband, Clark Mason, is no longer here. I'm going to try to see if I can find to at least get a distress beacon out. Wish me luck.
			Until we meet again in heaven,
			Clark Mason</i>
