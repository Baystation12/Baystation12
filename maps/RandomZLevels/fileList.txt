#List the potential random Z-levels here.
#Maps must be the full path to them
#Maps should be 255x255 or smaller and be bounded.  Falling off the edge of the map will result in undefined behavior. 
#Please ensure that your maps have a minimum distnace from the edge of 10 units, due to 'seamless transition' range
#SPECIFYING AN INVALID MAP WILL RESULT IN RUNTIMES ON GAME START
