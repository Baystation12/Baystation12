	extended_round_description = "The successes of the SEV Torch's past missions have marked the ship as \
	a highly valuable target for many organizations and individuals. The varied pasts \
	and experiences of the crew have left them susceptible to the vices and temptations of humanity. \
	Are you in the safe self-contained workplace you once thought it was, or has it become a playground \
	for the evils of the galaxy? Who can you trust? Watch your front. Watch your sides. Watch your back. \
	The familiar faces that you've passed hundreds of times down the hallways before can be hiding terrible \
	secrets and deceptions. Every corner is a mystery. Every conversation is a lie. You will be facing your \
	friends and family as they try to use your emotions and trust to their advantage, leaving you with nothing \
	but the painful reminder that space is cruel and unforgiving."
