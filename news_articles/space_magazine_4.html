    Events transpire across the stars. The latest in a string of incidents involving violence between Humans and IPCs happened on an outer human colony, a
    lucky string of events made an unlucky man a hero, a new creature has come from the depths of Bluespace out of Erebus, and several big events involving
    NanoTrasen. This is SPACE.

<h2>Today’s Pogrom? IPC Community violently removed from Human Colony</h2>
<br>
<p>
    On the colony of Tove in the Alexander System near Nyx, human colonists forcefully removed a small community of IPCs that had made the world their home.
    The community, numbering no greater than two dozen, had been there for nearly a year before the event. The colony itself maintained almost no contact with
    the IPCs besides for trade. In recent years, the Fury of Mankind had taken up roots in Tove, along with the wave of Nu-Luddite teachings in the outer
    colonies, Tove was ripe for action. Nearly 10 of the IPC’s positronic systems were destroyed, and the rest have either been displaced on the colony, or
    captured by the Tove Militia. No one knows if Sol Gov will force the colony to release the IPCs to send them back home or if serious action will be taken.

<h2>Threat from Bluespace?</h2>
<br>
<p>
    In the last years, multitude of incidents has been reported from stations around the Nyx system, involving sightings of rapidly growing gelatinous green
    goo. This goo, familiarly called "blob" by the engineers responsible for handling it, is causing thousands of thalers worth of damage around Nyx every day,
    in the form of destroyed hull plates or various machinery. This phenomena has resisted studies by various researchers for multiple years now.
</p>
<p>
    This has changed last week, as well known expert in the field of bluespace theory, researcher Kaden Smith finally published their study, on which they have
    been working in the last five years, using remains of specimens brought from multiple stations. According to their study, the blob is a plant-like
    substance that grows in contained bluespace pockets. These pockets may react with the solar radiation emitted by Erebus, to temporarily expose small chunk
    of the blob to normal space. If this occurs while a station or ship is passing through the area, the piece of blob may be literally ripped out of it's
    bluespace pocket. As the blob is not used to normal space, it will immediately begin growing to protect itself. Due to it's unique molecular structure, it
    is capable of corroding nearly any material, given sufficient time. This is usually quickly noticed by the crews, which have learned over time that
    concentrated heat, such as, from welding torches or beam weaponry can be used to neutralise the growth, and eventually destroy it for good.
</p>
<p>
    As the blob is not capable of existing in normal space for extended periods of time, it is not possible to safely contain one specimen for longer than few
    hours. After few hours of exposure to normal space the blob begins to wither, and eventually disappears completely, as it's celluar structure falls apart.
    Any attempts to prolong the blob's existence in normal space have failed, yet the specimens that were secured and transported to laboratories within time
    have provided sufficient data on what the blob actually is.

<h2>Travesty Averted, Unlucky Hero or Lucky Zero?</h2>
<br>
<p>
    Benjamin Watts. This name, to some, is the name of a man who refuses to pay his taxes, refuses to work or attend meetings at certain times, and preaches
    extremist views. However, since Tuesday evening, he has been lauded as a hero across the net.
</p>
<p>
    Benjamin lives and works on the small facility of NTB Arcop V, which resides on the moon of Roanake above Erebus in the Nyx system. Tuesday around 14:00 a
    Sol Central vessel docked with the facility and was carrying a small team to investigate Benjamin before detaining him for tax evasion. After moving Mr.
    Watts to the vessel, he noticed a malfunction and detected the presence of phoron. After attempting to warn the crew they were in danger, Mr. Watts somehow
    retrieved one of the officers' LAE90 energy guns and created a hostage situation, forcing everyone back into the station. Within a few seconds of being
    back on station Mr. Watts was shot seven times in the arms and torso in an assault of both directed energy and ballistics. In mere seconds after Benjamin
    was shot, the vessel's integrity gave way and went up in a fireball, shocking the crew. Still in recovery, Benjamin refuses to make a statement, but it
    seems he is still to be detained. People across the net are praising him as a hero and demanding he be cleared of charges. His coworkers give mixed
    reports, however. In regards to his staunch stance on Christianity, one coworker says, "Ben's a good guy and all, but I can't say he doesn't have some
    [explicit] up views...we get in to it all the time." One of the investigators was reported saying that even though he saved her life, "...the law is the
    law..." Reports suggest he avoids paying some of his taxes due to him not supporting certain projects those tax thalers would fund. The Central Colonial
    Administrator of Roanake has not made a statement or responded to requests for one yet.

<h2>NanoTrasen Retires Their Nyx Recycling Initiative</h2>
<br>
<p>
    NanoTrasen has officially retired their new Nyx recycling/trash processing stations due to multiple raids of the Vox variety. Sources state that they are
    attracted to the prospect of free goods and materials as well as the lax, if non-existant security detail. NanoTrasen officials have stated that they will
    abandon these stations as 'the machinery onboard can not be repurposed satisfactorily', inside sources indicate that NanoTrasen believes the transportation
    of the machines carry a high raid risk and do not wish to lose anymore money to this venture.
</p>
<p>
    The original purpose of this initiative was to build low cost stations in which scrap, debris, and similar objects floating along Erebus are transported to
    be reprocessed back into profitable metal pieces. Showing initial success with their first plant, NanoTrasen quickly built 3 more, but tragedy struck as
    they were attacked numerous times by Vox raiders, who were seemingly intent on profiting from the new plants. NanoTrasen attempted to firmly secure said
    stations, but the profit margins proved to be too low to adequately defend from the Vox, and the initiative was promptly retired, and abandoned.

<h2>SEV Magnus: Where did it go?</h2>
<br>
<p>
    In the last issue, we discussed the disappearance of the SEV Magnus, one of the flagship vessels of the Expeditionary Corps. In the search for the missing
    vessel, investigators have discovered a crashed escape pod, surprisingly, in a different system from where the Magnus had disappeared. The crew inside will
    be having their neural laces transmitted to new bodies to find out what happened to the ship, with rumors circulating from a new type of Vox attack,
    fighting with the Sirisai Empire, or even a new species of Aliens we haven’t encountered before.

<h2>NanoTrasen named TSC of the year</h2>
<br>
<p>
	In the most recent release of Forbes 500, NanoTrasen was named corporation of the year due to their profit margins and high levels of productivity. The corporation, as well as the Trasen Family, were ecstatic about the news but others would disagree. Certain members of the FTU, and other corporations have called "foul play" against NanoTrasen for stacking stocks in their favor for this update.
</p>
<p>
	NanoTrasen's profits have increased by over twenty percent in the last five years. The company claims that profits have increased due to expansion of phoron mining operations, as well as research activities. In the last year NanoTrasen has finished construction of three additional research facilities, and has hired over two thousand new employees. NanoTrasen's research division has recently published new breakthroughs in the area of energetic materials, that may lead to improved weapons or more efficient power generators.
</p>
<p>
	On the other hand, critics claim that NanoTrasen has achieved it's profit increase by reducing maintenance funding and pay of low education employees. Industrial workers, such as, phoron miners or construction engineers often complain that they have to work with faulty and old equipment. The average pay of these workers also dropped recently, which supports these claims.
