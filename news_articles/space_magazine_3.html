<title>SPACE - Issue #3</title>
<p>
    Breakthroughs and fallouts throughout Space. The Interstellar Assembly has been officially created, but not all species are so willing to put forward their
    places in it, thinking it a ploy for Humanity to control them perhaps? As well, a massive lost in Positronic Union space resulting in 350 casualties from a
    scientific detonation. Finally, with the resurgence into exploration by the Sol Gov Expeditionary Corps comes another blow to their mission - The SEV
    Magnus has disappeared in the far outer Trajan System as it was readying to explore further past. Experts believe this may be related to the skirmishes
    with unknown vessels discussed in the last issue.

<h2 class="heading">The Interstellar Assembly - a United Galaxy in the Modern Age?</h2>
<p class="author">Written by Liam Cohen</p>
<p>
    In recent years, discussion has been proposed between the different civilizations over the creation of an Assembly, or Union, between the different species
    so as to have a more diplomatic and open approach to dealing with the problems that each species faces. It seems that those dreams are coming, if
    grudgingly slowly, true. The announcement of the Interstellar Assembly's creation earlier this year is a major victory for Diplomacy in known space,
    leading way for better trade, ambassador work, and aid between Humanity, Tajara, Unathi, and Skrell. Critics have claimed that its unjust, as Resomi were
    not given a spot on the Assembly, but supporters say that the Assembly will bring the species together like nothing has before. Currently, the only species
    who has not supported any representatives are the Skrell, while Humanity has enough for each position to be filled. After having discussions with each
    candidate, these are my understanding of what they believe in for this Assembly, and their species being a part of it:
</p>
<p>
    First - Vladimir Stepanovich Grekov, a hard, uncompromising man with Humanity on his mind. He wants Humanity first, and not backing down from expanding it
    further.
</p>
<p>
    Second - Tamandani Pal Dibra, one of the more extremist politicians that have been on the rise in recent years, Dibra wants a purely Human economy, no
    other species taking Human jobs or Human homes.
</p>
<p>
    Third - Solomon David Kennedy, a younger fellow with more spots than the others, he's an optimist and wants to bring everyone together. Many wonder if this
    young man will even be able to handle the job, despite a solid, if short, record.
</p>
<p>
    Fourth - Elizabeth Merryweather, a swell woman of the extravagant Merryweather Family, she's in support of species interactions, and development between
    them, but the same questions that were raised with Kennedy are raised with her.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    From the Unathi, we have - Viskï¿½ker Orisk, an honorable Unathi, and elegant speaker. He's seeking a bigger seat for Unathi at the galactic table.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    And from the Tajara, Shahla Al-Marad, another elegant speaker, and with a better record than some possible members, she's seeking much of the same as
    Orisk, a bigger seat for the Tajara.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Who knows if we will see these people when the positions have been decided, but that is far away from now.

<h2 class="heading">Experiment ends in 350 lives lost, Positronic Union Devastated</h2>
<p class="author">Written by Liun Asitero</p>
<p>
    In a press release earlier today, Fleet Admiral KM of the Positronic Union Self Defense Force (USDF) announced the loss of 350 lives during a government
    sanctioned experiment. The 350 individuals, including 325 crewmen and 25 Government scientists and officials were aboard a vessel in the fringes of Union
    occupied space conducting a classified test when the vessel was reported to have spontaneously detonated. After a thorough search through the wreckage, The
    USDF has reported that all hands have been lost, and only 273 bodies were recovered. Among those lost included Dr. BrAUN of the Ministry of Science, an
    expert in the field of theoretical bluespace manipulation technology. The location of the incident has been placed under military quarantine during the
    duration of the investigation and will remain classified until the investigation is complete to prevent possible contamination.

    SPACE has attempted to contact the Union Ministry of Science and Exploration for comment, but has not received any response at this time.

<h2 class="heading">Missing Vessel: Rescue Service calls off the search for missing Sol Expeditionary Vessel</h2>
<p class="author">Written by Andrea Sharpe</p>
<p>
    The SCG Rescue Service has suspended their search for the SEV Magnus and its 38 crewmembers, which went missing late last month while mapping the Great
    Orion Nebula. The last official contact with the Magnus was in mid-April, during a routine communications check. At that time, the vessel reported no major
    issues other than unusual stellar interference with its navigation equipment. Alarms were raised after the vessel missed its next two scheduled check in
    times, and did not respond to any communications attempts.
</p>
<p>
    Due to the distance of the Orion Nebula, search and rescue craft from the Defense Forces, Rescue Service, and Expeditionary Corps were unable to reach the
    Magnus' last known coordinates until early May. When asked if the search had been cut short due to logistical issues, or because any remain of the vessel
    had been found, the Rescue Service declined to comment, only saying that the search had been suspended due to safety concerns on the advice of the Defense
    Forces. Ted Rozac, the chief media coordinator for the Expeditionary Corps said, "We are saddened to learn that there were no survivors aboard the Magnus,
    our hearts and prayers are with the families and friends of the Crew, as well as with the victims of this disaster."
</p>
<p>
    Speculation continued after the announcement, especially among conspiracy circles. While many analysts support the theory that the Magnus' reactor
    detonated, due to the absence of debris, and trace radiation in the vessel's last known location; there are still unanswered questions about the damaged
    escape pod that was reportedly found empty early in the search. Stranger still are the rumors of damage to several of the SGDF escorts that were involved
    in the search, though no official statement has been released addressing these reports. Whether or not this disappearance will be tied to the classified
    engagements in the Trajan system remains to be seen, and without much verified evidence, it's likely that the mystery of the SEV Magnus will persist for
    some time.
