<p>
	Events transpire across the stars. A massive Cyborg Smuggling Ring on the Emerald Habitation in Nyx was broken up, an Ancient Alien Ruin was discovered by
	the SEV Vanguard, one of Sol Gov's Expeditionary Ships, and tacked along with that- more controversy over the Expeditionary Corps'  Mission in the Stars.

<h2 class="heading">Police Break Cyborg Slavery Ring on Emerald Habitation</h2>
<p class="author">written by Tuan Jinhai</p>
<p>
	Residents of Emerald Habitation in the Nyx system were shocked this morning to discover that thousands of residents had been illegal
	converted into low-quality cyborgs by a ring of smugglers and disgraced surgeons.
</p>
<p>
	Bronze-Crawler Ltd, the former subsidiary corporation of Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals was revealed today by a long-term undercover sting
	operation to be a front for the conversion of heavily indebted biological workers into low-grade cyborgs with the promise of "working
	off their debts". The group also ran a small smuggling operation which brought illegal augmentations into Emerald Habitation and took
	the barely functioning cyborgs off station; this smuggling ring has also been dismantled by this police operation.
</p>
<p>
	The indentured cyborgs created by this shoddy process did not conform to any industry standards and the resulting cyborgs had greatly
	reduced processing capacity along with barely functioning and out-of-date components which resulted in several incidents of workplace
	fatalities across the sector. These incidences were how the authorities first became aware of the malfunctioning cyborgs and the
	resulting multi-station investigations finally moved in this morning to apprehend the criminals.
</p>
<p>
	Bronze-Crawler Ltd is known locally as a small chain of cyborg repair shops that specialise in affordable care for damaged robots
	and cyborgs on Emerald Habitation. Police raids all 7 of their shops both on this and other stations and planets have caused concern
	for many individuals as to whether the other cyborgs worked upon by this corporation have been influenced in any manner. Official
	guidance is for anyone worried about this issue to contact a reputable company for investigation.
</p>
<p>
	A statement released by Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals denied all involvement with this "rogue corporation"  and they stated that they had
	only "a passing acquaintances, many years ago, with this corporation".  Despite their protestations of innocence, Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals
	suffered on the stock markets as the news circulated, with share prices falling by 5 Thallers within the first 12 hours of the news being released.
</p>
<p>
	Local authorities have refused to comment on the issue or the sting operation itself, but representatives from the Positronic Union stated
	that they "oppose this heinous enslavement of sentient minds", they went on to state that they "will provide whatever assistance that we can
	to return the victims to the state of their choosing, whether this be biological or mechanical".
</p>
<p>
	Police are still tracking down a number of the affected worker cyborgs, and have put out a small reward for any information that will lead
	to the return of these indentured minds to their families and to their lives.

<h2 class="heading">The Mystery of Croria 7C</h2>
<p class="author">Written by Liam Cohen</p>
<p>
	Explorers returned to Mars with strange news today. Relaying their daring adventures to the planet, named Croria 7C by the team,
	they told of their extraordinary encounters on an uncharted world. SEV Vanguard, an Expeditionary Corp exploration ship, was on an
	routine mission when it came across unusual radiation readings, similar to bluespace technology usage, on the uninhabitable planet
	on the fringes of known space.
</p>
<p>
	Croria 7C exists far too close to its sun for any known species to inhabit it, and its ferocious continent-sized firestorms that continually
	rage across the planet along with the lethal solar radiation-storms that regularly scour the surface make it far from an ideal location to colonise.
	Despite this, initial scans of the planet revealed 4 small bunker-like structures clustered together on the surface and the Expeditionary Corp team travelled
	down to the planet to investigate them.
</p>
<p>
	What they found defied believe. The buildings had no discernable entrances or openings and appear to have be completely unmarked by the solar storms that raged
	across the planets with no apparent technology to protect the structures from the enviroment. The smooth, marble-like structures hold no external clues to their
	purpose or creators and their only sign of activity is that they emit a previously unknown type of radiation in regular bursts.
</p>
<p>
	Expert analysis of the reports by professors from Trinta Central University on Mars indicate that the radiation type emitted from these bunkers, though similar
	to that produced by technology used to enter and exit bluespace, is unique and unseen before with no known technology emitting such radiation. The mysterious
	structures prompt many to question, "who made them and where are they now?".
</p>
<p>
	This recent revelation comes at a time when many are openly criticising the use and objectives of the Expeditionary Corp. Critics are suggesting that this
	information arrived at exactly the right time to justify the Expeditionary Corp's pay checks. Samantha Varela, a senior member of the Committee for Diplomatic
	Relations has replied by stating "The arrival logs for the SEV Vanguard are publicly accessible. Sol Space Traffic Control logs clearly show the ship arriving
	in system only a few days ago. We released this information as soon as we could to the general public".
</p>
<p>
	Though explorations of the structures and the surrounding area was quickly brought to a dramatic halt by the planets extreme weather, many voices are not calling
	for further investigation into the matter and rumours have been surfacing of a second, better funded expedition, being sent to investigate the planet shortly,
	though ongoing repairs to damage that SEV Vanguard received on its explorations of Croria 7C prevent it from being the ship that investigates the mystery they discovered.

<h2 class="heading">Controversy Rises Against the Expeditionary Corp</h2>
<p class="author">Written by David Spadesberg</p>
<p>
	Olympian Riot Police used tear gas and stun beams to disperse protesters today outside of the Assembly Chambers today, as protests against the Expeditionary Corps
	continued for their second consecutive week. Protests grew violent today following a visit by members of the Assemblies to the Expeditionary flagship, the SEV Torch,
	still undergoing refit at the Shiva Fleet Yards in orbit above Mars. Members of the self-proclaimed "Gaia's Alliance" movement approached the police cordon outside
	the Assemblies and reportedly began to throw stones and rudimentary pyrotechnics at the security forces. Protesters dispersed, and several were arrested following
	the deployment of mech-suited officers and police synthetics.
</p>
<p>
	Anti-Government protesters have been encamped outside of the Assembly Chambers since last week's vote to increase funding to the Committee for Diplomatic Relations,
	especially the Expeditionary Corps. Protesters have submitted a manifesto detailing a variety of grievances, ranging from accusations that SolGov is attempting
	to increase its reach and influence without regard to the Colonies, to demands for non-human citizenship in SolGov. When asked for a comment relating to the arrest
	of their leader, Sub-Commandant Cristal Orkid, an unnamed Gaia's Alliance protester said, "The brutal crackdown by the regime on these just and righteous protests
	is yet another example of how a human-centric empire encroaches on the rights of Sapients everywhere". Since the dispersion of the largest body of protestors, the
	remainder have taken up residence in a school nearby, and are planning their next move.
</p>
<p>
	While it seems that these days protests are nothing special, this latest wave of protests marks a definite increase in anti-SolGov activism and political sentiment.
	In the wake of an increasing budget for the Defense Forces over the last few years, some see the additional spending on exploration as a guise for military expansionism,
	and old-school colonial expansion. While our interstellar neighbors, the Skrell, have commented little on recent events, colonies both inside and outside of the SCG have
	expressed misgivings about the militarization of the borders. Just this week, Chief Minister Alexeev spoke to reporters on the steps of the Confederate Hall of
	Government saying, "As we have maintained for years, Olympus will only be happy once all of the colonies are under their banner. Any colonies rethinking their membership
	in this imperial venture are of course welcome with the Confederacy, and we will defend the neutrality of any colony that wishes to stay unaffiliated".
</p>
<p>
	When asked for comment, Secretary-General Barros declined to respond, but the Assemblies will be having a joint session next week to discuss preliminary reports
	that several colonies may secede. Security will be tripled, and the Home Guard is being deployed currently as a precaution. Regardless of your position on the
	issue, anyone planning on visiting the Capital should adjust their trip accordingly.
