<p><title>SPACE - Issue #2</title></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    Times are changing. New advancements in bionic engineering at Hephaistos may prove a way for immortality. Occult murders cause mass hysteria, prison breaks
    of some of the most dangerous people to ever, and a possibility of new life amongst the stars. This is SPACE.

<h2>Have We Found Immortality?</h2>
<br>

<p>
    Approximately two weeks ago, the Prosthesis Enhancement Research Division of Hephaistos Industries has announced a new breakthrough that may cause another
    wave of controversy in the coming decade concerning bio-augmentations and prosthesis. It is even speculated that its final release may cause an uprising of
    a similar scale as the one between 22nd and 23rd century, which followed after the augmentation market has been opened to public, causing major moral
    concerns. A new model of Hephaestus' own apex quality X series has been in development for 6 years and has now reached stage of beta testing; the X-08
    Zeus. While the X models usually feature a variety of features and uses, Zeus only has one, but all the more significant: To achieve immortality.
</p>
<p>
    "We are excited to announce a significant advance in development of our new product, X-08 Zeus. With it, you may discard all fear of danger, of your rising
    age... of your death. Zeus features a never-foreseen combination of the most advanced technology and pristine material engineering available to all our
    races to ascend its user to power worthy of the Ancient Greek deity that our model bears the name of. [...]" states the press release with which the X-08
    was set to light. The announcement was met with a colorful combination of disbelief and speculations, as well as an avalanche of questions and requests of
    inverviews, including ones from this author, that were all fruitless efforts.
</p>
<p>
    This is to be expected, after all, Hephaistos promises features that have always been deemed entirely impossible. The press release claims a Zeus user has
    withstood direct exposure to a blast furnace, withstanding temperatures present at low orbits of Red Dwarf stars. It has been targeted by a powerful EMP
    pulse that reportedly damaged most measuring equipment yet the user registered no complications. Its Bulk and Young's Modulus are immeasurable, with all
    stress tests including industrial grade crushers and drills having no test results as the resistance is entirely off charts. A great variety of weapon
    penetration testing as been also performed, including many types of ballistic and energy weaponry, and even a large thermobaric charge, with no visible
    effect and no structural damage, even on a microscopic scale. Most importantly, it is claimed that Zeus is capable of eternal cellular regeneration, so
    even if any injury is suffered, it is regenerated fully within an hour, and the aging process is slowed to a hear halt, estimating approximately quintuple
    lifespans.
</p>
<p>
    Hephaistos categorically refuses to answer any questions that would inquire if there is any way to harm or kill a Zeus user, only adding the procedure is
    so extensive the user is made into a new being regardless. As of now Hephaistos has informed that currently only Humans are fully compatible with the
    augmentations. Skrell register low effectiveness, tests have been attempted on Unathi with various errors occuring, ranging with severity from permanent
    impairment to death, to which Hephaistos claims to be on a good way towards mitigating them. Tests on Resomi and Vox have been entirely discontinued, and
    these races have been labeled incompatible entirely. The identity of test subjects is claimed to have been entirely deleted, and Hephaistos discourages any
    and all inquiries and efforts in discovering them.
</p>
<p>
    Does this mean humanoid beings are on their way to ascend to a whole new level of existence? Should this be allowed as there are already groups of people
    claiming Hephaistos is 'playing God'? Is this all simply a fluke to artificially inflate Hephaistos Industries stock ratings in an attempt to overtake
    Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals? We may only know more in the coming years.

<h2>Occult Societies - Mass Murderers?</h2>
<br>

<p>
    Recently, on the colony of Brinkburn in the distant Nyx System, members of an occult societies sacrificed somewhere around 37 people, and injured dozens
    more. This is only the most recent in a string of attacks and “sacrificial” murders that have happened in the last decade.
</p>
<p>
    Since the discovery of Phoron, and the enhancement of Bluespace technology, Cults have been on the rise across Human space, each worshipping their own god,
    goddess, or more. Some are light, and not a trouble, but others have turned ultra-violent, murdering and turning to cannibalistic tendencies. Peacekeepers
    for Sol Gov have officially designated these “Ultra-Violent” Cults as Terrorists, and are to be treated as such, but what about their teachings? What
    causes these people to do such horrific things? We sat down with one of the leaders to talk about it.
</p>
<p>
    Jara, the only name we were given, is a follower of the Cult of a Nar’sie, a group of fanatical zealots that follow a God of Death and Destruction, who
    plans to turn the universe into pure nothingness. You could almost say that the religion is a revival of Nihilism into the 26th Century.
</p>
<p>
    “So, Jara, why does your cult sacrifice people to your god?”
</p>
<p>
    <i>“To Nar’Sie.”</i>
</p>
<p>
    “Yes, to Nar’sie.”
</p>
<p>
    <i>“It all comes to him being The God. He swallowed the creator and plans to take his creation, but cannot, because they are…[one]. We sacrifice to feed him,
    to bring him into our [world], to spread his idea to the whole of life.”</i>
</p>
<p>
    “Why does Nar’sie want..well, the universe?”
</p>
<p>
    <i>“Because the universe is creation, and creation was an error.”</i>
</p>
<p>
    Shortly after our interviewer recorded this conversation, uploading it directly to her boss, she disappeared and hasn’t been heard from since. Her
    interview, left unfinished. The Cult of Nar’sie is considered one of the most violent of the bunch to have come in the last few years, and is growing in
    numbers. Recently, activity has taken a foothold in Nyx, where the earlier discussed attack on Brinkburn occurred. There have also been sightings of
    strange beasts born of blood, and bone, but we have been unable to confirm such reports.

<h2>Problems at the Gulch</h2>
<br>

<p>
    The Gulch, a state of the art, privatized correctional facility in the outer rim of the Nyx System, recently had a prison break, resulting in somewhere
    around 150 of its most dangerous inmates escaping into the system. No one is quite sure how it happened, but we went to the Founder of Gulch, Mwenye
    Alofabi, to discuss what happened.
</p>
<p>
    “Well, a riot had begun in the Hall. We do not keep a prison yard, and so, the only place for prisoners see each other are in the [Hall]. Its a long,
    rounding hallway that has every cell located on it, going up and down throughout the facility. Since the only way out is on a ship, we keep the shipping
    yard where arrivals and shipments arrive as far away from the prisoners as possible.
</p>
<p>
    The riot started from several inmates, and eventually spread throughout the Hall. Around six or seven guards were beaten to death, before the prisoners
    made it to the Hangar. They climbed aboard the few ships we had, as it was new arrivals day and somehow shipments arrived at the same time, and they were
    able to escape the facility. We are quite positive they had outside help, especially since our defense systems were shutdown just as the ships left the
    Hangar, and a bomb went off in my office during the riot. We are still working on how to handle the issue, but so far, none of the prisoners have been
    returned.”
</p>
<p>
    This is the latest in a string of controversies surrounding The Gulch, with the others involving the tortures of prisoners, and a guard raping one of the
    women inmates. Most likely, the escaped prisoners have hidden themselves on of the planets in the system, or moons, but it is quite uncertain.

<h2>Unidentified Vessels Attack SolGov Frigates</h2>
<br>

<p>
    Earlier this week, in the outermost reaches of SolGov control, the Trajan System, frigates were moving supplies and equipments through the system when
    vessels not matching any known signatures opened fire. Nothing is for certain of the event, as the frigates were stripped of all goods, people, and worthy
    equipment, but the ships have not been matched with any human vessels, nor those of the other species that we have aligned ourselves. Their technological
    level was quite high, as there were no indicators of them on the frigates’ radar systems, and not even the Vox are that able to take down completely, four
    frigates. Only time will tell if these are a new brand of ships owned by terrorists, or a new, alien threat to Human interests in the galaxy.
