<title> Welcome to SPACE Magazine </title>
<p>
    SPACE Magazine is a new force in Journalism in the 26th Century- bringing news and information to the multitudes of Star Systems settled by Sentient Life,
    letting everyone know what's happening across the Stars, millions of miles away. News if first and foremost our forte, but articles over important
    individuals and new developments will also be here in the magazine, which we shall ship out every month with a new issue. This, is our very first issue,
    and we hope to continue for many years to come.
</p>
<p>
    In this first issue, we will address a few incidents that have come up as of recent days- a attempted, but disastrous attack by Pirates against the colony
    of Onaios Prime, thwarted by the latest in weapons technology. A meteor shower that rained disaster on the colonial world of Brinkburn in the lucrative
    system of Nyx, causing many citizens to leave the planet. An attack by terrorists on the colony of Asilliss VII, resulting in many deaths, and the Great
    Carp Migrations that have been occurring in recent days in the Nyx System.

<h2 class="heading">Pirates Underestimate Colonial Defenses</h2>
<p class="author">Written by Liun Asitero </p>
<p>
    This week, a pirate group that has stolen a SolGov Battlecruiser has attempted to commit a raid with it upon a colony world Onaios Prime, in the Onaios
    system. However, it was quickly eradicated along with its escort by a planetside battery of Mass Drivers produced recently by Dawnlight Celestial Defence.
    After this incident Dawnlight has registered an influx of demand from other colonies, as their weapons are relatively affordable, registering slight growth
    in stock ratings for the first time in 250 years, when the success of Dawnlight even competed with corporations like Hephaestus. We have found a written
    account of one of the writers of local news agency, and with their permission are including it in this article.
</p>
<p>
    It was almost midnight when I was driving around the AURA 2, a new anti-orbital installation, on my way home from my office, after some overtime. I have
    heard of its construction project and have never paid much attention to it, the world of Onaios Prime that I live on has always been only moderately
    wealthy, and peaceful... until last night. A loud siren played from the complex's direction, breaking the silence of the night. I stopped my vehicle where
    an overhang down to the valley let me look at the platform, from 50 meters above it, and about 300 meters away from it, and I saw it for my first time.
</p>
<p>
    A great bunker in the middle was having its windows shut in blast doors, shying away from the reason this is an anti-orbital installation: The jeeps and
    trucks that were scurrying to hide in the bunker were but the tiniest little dot, compared to the massive Mass Drivers, that slowly, but so steadily, with
    a bass, gentle hum, began towering to the sky, reaching out to it with a barrel so long you would need two loaded semi-trucks to cover the length. The
    barrels aligned, and I could still hear the humming, but it started growing stronger, stronger... before one of the barrels sparked inside a few times, and
    I was blinded by a vast flash... Only then, the humming cut off, only then, I heard the lightning, and only then, a spiking, overwhelming pitch of
    capacitor discharge plummeted to my eardrums, only to be followed by an encroaching thunder of a blastwave, shunting masses of air against me.
</p>
<p>
    Only after a few seconds, I regained my hearing and sight to feel the echoes of the blast, and to see another Mass Driver was discharging, sparking. I
    covered the sight of it in time, to see the entire valley was lit for a split second as well as the sun could do, and I heard the discharge again, and I
    heard its calling. Every spike, a declaration of freedom. Every thunderblast, a declaration of sovereignty. The Mass Drivers would flash, marking dawn upon
    the invaders to signal the humanity made its stand here, and it shall persevere. The warhead that it would expel was our fist that would smite them from
    our sky. I did not know who have we fought against at that time, but at that moment, and ever since, I never looked at the night sky the same way again. I
    believe that that sky is our home.

<h2 class="heading">Brinkburn Refugees and Sapient's Rights</h2>
<p class="author">Written by Laura Hunton </p>
<p>
    One of Nyx's planets, Brinkburn, has had a catastrophe happen in form of a meteor storm three days ago. Nyx has lashed out with a solar corona that, while
    having a miniscule effect on traffic and stations, has managed to deflect several asteroids from the belt natively present around Brinkburn. This caused
    massive, unsustainable damage to the habitation complexes present on the planet that are occupied by several hundreds of settlers, and given their scarce
    material stocks, they had no other choice but to escape, to find another place to survive in.
</p>
<p>
    The situation was further complicated by the very asteroid rings that have started this misfortune; the refugees did not have sufficiently advanced
    navigation computers on their pods to steer them safely through the rings. Approximately 20% of population is estimated to have not made it through. The
    shuttles that have shipped the settlers on the world in the first place needed to be dismantled and used for scrap to expand the living area, and the more
    advanced components were used to wrangle the escape pods together.
</p>
<p>
    Most of the refugees have found their way to Emerald Habitation, a station in Nyx. The station already has issues with over-population and air
    purification, and the sudden influx of human settlers has introduced even more problems. Firstly, it has made it much harder to process travelers passing
    through, making travel in Nyx either very dangerous through Void Star, or very expensive through NAS Crescent. Secondly, Emerald Habitation has been
    housing a large number of Unathi, which have been harassing the refugees, some of them are even a part of the station's security, making appeals to them
    only worsen the situation.
</p>
<p>
    We can only hope a new home will be found and built for the poor refugees, and that the Skrell present on station, that are keeping the situation
    relatively free of casualties, continue to sustain a safe, if not non-hostile environment on the overpopulated station.

<h2 class="heading">Terror Attack on Asilliss VII</h2>
<p class="author">Written by Johnathan Townsend</p>
<p>
    Planet Asilliss VI has been a civil uprising hotspot for a few weeks now, and things have recently yet again escalated. A research facility belonging to
    NanoTrasen, one of several to be specific, that specializes on an undisclosed project, has been attacked by a group of masked raiders armed with automatic
    weapons, using several buggies for transport. Two hours after the incident, Asilliss Liberation Force claimed responsibility. "Companies like NanoTrasen
    are advancing us, but into slavery and containment! Their technology only brings control to the corrupt over the honest people of Asilliss! We cannot stand
    idle! Join us and befall those who take our lives from our control!", claimed a man hiding in a shade on video that was sent to a local entertainment
    station to be broadcasted under threat of attack.
</p>
<p>
    Up until now, the government's militia has been relatively ineffective at quelling this terrorist cell, while their statistics register a number of arrests
    and casualties, the group is still registering influx of recruits. However, NanoTrasen seems to have been highly impacted by this attack, judging from
    press release of NanoTrasen, Nyx Division: "As a company, we must maintain our safety standard for our employees, as well as secure our installations. The
    continued unrest on Asilliss that is resulting in loss of investments is forcing our hand to resort to particularly prejudicial measures and we are
    arranging cooperation with the governmental forces."
</p>
<p>
    We have information from a trusted source, who we shall allow to remain unnamed, that NanoTrasen is arranging a loan to Asiliss in form of acquisition of a
    small number of vehicles from Terraphistus Military Armor and small arms shipped all the way from Mars Security Industries, as well as hiring services from
    a newly instated PMC, SAARE, to protect other NanoTrasen's installations. We have very little information on SAARE due to its novelty, except that it has
    accepted several decorated veterans from various security forces and armies, and specializes on top secret operations. Only time will tell if these
    measures shall be taken and how shall they affect the unrest on Asilliss IV, but be sure that we shall provide our readers with full coverage!

<h2 class="heading">The Great Carp Migration</h2>
<p class="author">Written by Peggy Re'saih</p>
<p>
    Carp and Pike have plagued space station windows and ship paint jobs for the past hundred years, and while local businesses make money off of eradicating
    them by the hundreds, they only seem to increase in number and size. Xenobiologists at Brickburn have come to the conclusion that that these pests most
    likely came from Erebus. "Was really hard to figure out at first," says researcher Gregory Hills, "They really like to, you know, bite things. But once we
    got a few hundred tagged ones out there the answer became pretty obvious." He went further on to explain that through their research they've created a
    basic carp life cycle, starting at the center of the gas giant and ending in the upper atmosphere, "They tend to die there.", he remarks, "Carp don't
    really survive in space unless they are really, really big. Hence why we get so many." When asked why the carp come to space in the first place, he shrugs,
    "We don't really know. We think maybe they can sense the stations up there somehow and are looking for food."
</p>
<p>
    Sadly this does not help much in protecting the citizens of the stars from the dreadful beasts. In the last month, there have been a reported 37 deaths due
    to Carp and Pike related incidents, making the Erebus Beasts a serious threat to people thinking of working on a station. Scientists believe that at some
    point this year, stations and ships in the Nyx System will be subjected to the largest migration of Carp and Pike that has ever been seen, and it may cause
    serious damage to interests in the system.
