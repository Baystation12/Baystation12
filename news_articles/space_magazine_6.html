<h2 class = "heading">Resomi Watchdog SFN Reports increased activity on Sirsian Border</h2>
<p class= "author">Written by Liun Asitero</p>
<p>
    Earlier today the Sirsian Freedom Network (SFN), a multi-stellar refugee assistance and watchdog organization released reports to the public detailing new
    behavior demonstrated by the Sirsian Empire along its borders facing Skrellian territory. The report cited drastic increases in activity along the border.
</p>
<p>
    Part of SFN's regular operation is monitoring and logging activity along borders to watch for any evidence of increased activity or expansion. SFN
    announced that over the last month, they have logged a 300% increase in unique vessels operating along the border, as well as confirmed the
    deployment of several stations of unknown purpose and what appears to be and array of communications buoys.
</p>
<p>
    "We don't know exactly what they're planning," says SFN spokesman Johnathan Knowles, "But what we've seen is consistent with some of our concerns.
    We believe that the empire is militarizing its borders, either to help prevent refugees from escaping, or to expand its borders to reclaim
    disconnected worlds."
</p>
<p>
    In response to the findings, several allied Skrell city-states along the border have scheduled an emergency conference to discuss what possible
    actions might be taken.

<h2 class = "heading">Insurrection on Mirania III</h2>
<p class = "author">Hadley Eislin</p>
<p>
    The colony of Mirania III has recently fallen into political turmoil. Just two solar weeks ago, the leader of the local colonial defense
    force, Bran Galton, seized control of the local government, proclaiming that the Solar Central Government has ignored the colony's needs
    for far too long. The newly self-proclaimed Republic of Mirania has declared that they are severing ties with Sol, and claim ownership of the
    entire Mirania-Habashi-Polego sector.
</p>
<p>
    In a public-spectrum sector wide announcement, a spokesman for the newly formed government accused the Sol Central Government of attempting to
    undermine the colony's newly declared independence. Meanwhile, reports of commercial vessels being boarded and seized by colonial defense forces
    continue to circulate through the sector, including those operated by NanoTrasen and Ward-Takahashi. Spokesmen from both trans-stellar corporations
    refused comment when questioned by TriSystem News.
</p>
<p>
    It is unclear how Sol intends to deal with the ongoing colonial crisis. According to one analyst, a peacekeeping deployment of the SCG fleet to the
    relatively remote Mirania-Habashi-Polego sector would be "a significant logistical challenge" and is "unlikely to be feasible" for at least several
    solar month's time. "A lot out here depends on how local colonial governments will respond to the developing situation."

<h2 class = "heading">More news on Resomi contact with the Positronic Union</h2>
<p class = "author">Chelsea Namara</p>
<p>
    A few months ago, the Positronic Union and Sirisian empire made contact in a system on the fringe of space.
    With a most information withheld from the media, it was difficult to report on, however, now it has become apparent that the Positronic Union has deployed
    their defense fleet on the border of the system SE-2301953, where they first made contact. Sources within the Sirisian Empire say that they are planning
    on removing the Positronic Union from the system.
</p>
<p>
    It appears the reason for this is several archaeological sites, finding ancient technology from the Sirisian Empire's past. The Positronic Union, has
    released several images of the sites, on one of the planets of the system, with Human, and IPC workers visible, (even a human smiling at the camera!).
    The remains, structures, and technology have not been dated. We have received exclusive rights to interview one of the Human Archaeologists working at
    the site, named Nicole Harding.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Harding</b>: "See, uh, when the site was found by orbital scan, they thought, 'Hm, who could this be?', then when they landed, they found the [resomi] bones.
    It was at that point, that they realised this was some kind of derelict base on the here [SE-2301953-C]." <br />
    <b>Interviewer</b>: "And when they reported it?"<br />
    <b>Harding</b>: "Well, obviously, we were sent to exhume the remains of the base, and figure out what happened, but this place also contains a wealth of
    technological advances, notably the [nanotech] medicine."<br />
    <b>Interviewer</b>: "So what do you think this facility was?"<br />
    <b>Harding</b>: "It was a whole colony, much of it is underground, covered under mounds of dirt."<br />
    <b>Interviewer</b>: "What do you think happened to the colony?"<br />
    <b>Harding</b>: "If the history of the Sirisian empire is to provide any evidence, I'd say this place was wiped clean by a nanoplague, then blown to crap from
    orbit, there's plenty of evidence for orbital bombardment, specifically the massive craters, in fact, here's a clump of dead nanomachines [in a jar]."<br />
    <b>Interviewer</b>: "Interesting, one last thing, about the Sirisian empire wanting to take this back, your thoughts?"<br />
    <b>Harding</b>: "I think they feel the technology we might discover here is dangerous, and that they have to prevent it's discovery, but thats my opinion,
    I have to get back to work now."<br />
    <b>Interviewer</b>: "Thank you for your time."
</p>
<p>
    In the meantime, it appears Positronic Union activity in the system remains un-interrupted.

<h2 class = "heading">Drug Bust Results in Recovery of Humanity's First Interstellar Probe</h2>
<p class = "author">Natalie Syline</p>
<p>
    The Colonial Marshal Bureau is the primary executive law enforcement body in the SCG, which means that when the bad guys headquarters needs to be busted
    open, they're the guys who authorize and supervise the operations. the CMB supervises about 30-40 busts a month within the core worlds, but one of their more
    recent busts turned up an unlikely item: The Voyager 1 probe.
</p>
<p>
    Originally launched on September 5, 1977 the almost 1 ton probe was part of a space exploration program funded by NASA, a long since defunct publicly funded space
    agency to explore the gas giants of the solar system. Using gravitational assists, the probe performed the first ever fly-by of both Jupiter and Saturn before
    catapulting into interstellar space faster than any man-made object at the time. Though communications with the probe ceased in 2017, it was still able to be
    tracked all the way up until it's theft by a crime syndicate in 2419.
</p>
<p>
    The probe ended up travelling around through the hands of many crime families before eventually becoming the heirloom of the Bogonovich crime family
    operating out of Saturn. With the probe now successfully recovered, CMB has announced plans to donate the probe to the Mars University Museum of Millennial
    Technology, where it will be showcased in the lobby as the first spacecraft to leave our solar system and enter interstellar space.

<h2 class = "heading">Scientists Propose Theory Linking Biology and Bluespace</h2>
<p class = "author">Richard Matthews</p>
<p>
    Bluespace technology has always been a new and interesting frontier. In the past hundred years, Humanity has made continuous advances in this particular field of
    research, ranging from new and faster methods of communication to the ability to jump across the stars in the blink of an eye, but there are mysteries yet unknown
    about bluespace. Bluespace, of course, gets its name from the effects it has on visible light when traveling through its turbulent wakes, though the average traveler
    will likely never see these effects as travelling via gateways uses safely calmed tunnels through bluespace. For the explorers and construction workers travelling
    without gateways though, the story is dramatically different. Bluespace drives allow for travel outside of gateways, but come with a slew of side-effects including
    the aforementioned blue color as well as disorientation from the occupants and the strange effect of allowing things to phase through solid matter which presents
    its own set of dangerous side-effects.
</p>
<p>
    Scientists have long questioned why the properties of matter in bluespace allow for this without causing complete cellular degradation in humans. Now physicist
    Johann Muller and biologist Andrew Romero believe they may have an answer.
</p>
<p>
    Muller and Romero's experiments sought to understand the effects of living creatures by sending cockroaches, ants, spiders, and mice on a short hop through
    bluespace. Bluespace teleporters work by projecting a field around its occupant and when the occupant reaches its target the field destabilizes, ejecting its
    occupant back into real-space. Using a specially designed teleporter, the two scientists sent their test subjects through a short 3ft bluespace jump without a
    field, then performed observations to study behavior and cellular degradation.
</p>
<p>
    The two scientist's experimentation showed some unexpected results. Organisms that had more advanced neural systems showed the least signs of cognitive and
    cellular degradation. Repetition at greater distances showed an exponential effect: the smarter the organism, the further it could travel and the longer it
    could stay in bluespace without major effects.
</p>
<p>
    What Muller and Romero now propose is that living organisms through some unknown method are capable of projecting a local bluespace manipulation field of
    their own that helps preserve cellular function, and that the more active the nervous system is of the organism, the stronger its field becomes. The scientists
    have named the phenomenon "Muller-Romero fields."
</p>
<p>
    While the implications of this new phenomenon are staggering, there is still much experimentation to be done. Physicists at prestigious universities all across
    SCG space are replicating the experiments and finding the similar results. What this means for the future of bluespace technology is unknown, but it seems that
    a new field of bluespace research is on the verge of discovery.
