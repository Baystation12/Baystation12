along with the walls that border them. This object is used extensively by the generator, and
has several assumptions embedded in it - think carefully before making changes</td></tr><tr><th><a href="obj/procedural/jp_dungeonroom.html">/obj/procedural/jp_dungeonroom</a></th><td>These objects are used to represent a 'room' - a distinct part of the dungeon
that is placed at the start, and then linked together. You will quite likely
want to create new jp_dungeonrooms.
