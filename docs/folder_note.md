GitHub allows repositories to create files which activate certain presentation features on their website.
GitHub looks for these files placed in the root directory, [/docs](/docs), and [/.github](/.github).
Only one copy of a file is necessary in any of these folders. Do not place multiple copies.

Files pertaining to GitHub presentation *only* should be placed in `/.github`.

Procedural and documentative information should be placed in `/docs`. Current and active legal information,
as well as the primary README.md, should be kept in `root`.

If any of these folder's contents conflict with terms and procedures defined in `root` or `/docs`, then `root`
or `/docs` will take precedence, in that order.
