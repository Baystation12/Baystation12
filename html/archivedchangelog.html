                <li class="rscadd">POSTERS! Posters come in rolled packages that can adhere to any wall or r_wall, if it's uncluttered enough.
                <BR><BR>?How they get on-board: The quartermaster can now set the receiver frequency of his supplycomp circuit board. A bit simplistic as of now, will work on it later. Building a supplycomp with a properly set up circuitboard will give access to the Contraband crate.
                <BR><BR>?How they're used: Unfold the rolled poster on any wall or r_wall to create the poster. There are currently 17 designs, with the possibility of me adding more.
                <BR><BR>?How to get rid of them: You can rip them using your hand... To cleanly extract them and not ruin them for future use, however, you can use a pair of wirecutters.
                <BR><BR>?How they're classified: They're contraband, so it's perfectly okay for security officers to confiscate them. Punishment for contraband-providers (or end-users, if you want to go full nazi) is up to the situational commanding officers.
