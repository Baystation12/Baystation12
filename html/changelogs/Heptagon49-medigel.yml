MediGel is made by taking select NT approved chemicals and mixing them with silicon and hydrochloric acid in a 4:1:1 ratio. Medigel chems work just like their counterparts, except their effects are dealt on touch, not on ingestion or when injected."

Potential side effects of intaking MediGel orally or intravenously may include, but are not limited to: nausia, bloating, excessive gas, intestinal distress, liver failure, kidney failure, brain failure, organ ruptures, system shock, total organ failure, death, and halitosis."
