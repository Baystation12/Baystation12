# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - experiment: "Bot AI has been overhauled, hopefully for the better."
  - experiment: "Navigation beacon (and, therefore, patrol) code has been changed; please report any issues with bot patrolling."
  - tweak: "Mulebots can't be hacked for speed anymore. They move at moderate speed. Safeties can still be disabled."
  - tweak: "Floorbots don't try to fix space anymore; instead they will remove broken tiles. They can be configured to cover platings, too."
  - tweak: "A farmbot has been added to the garden, and a floorbot to engineering storage."
