  - rscadd: "Malfunction Overhaul - Whole gamemode was completely reworked from scratch. Most old abilities have been removed and quite a lot of new abilities was added. AI also has to hack APCs to unlock higher tier abilities faster, instead of having access to them from the round start. Most forced things, such as, shuttle recalling were removed and are instead controlled by the AI. Code is fully modular allowing for future modifications."
