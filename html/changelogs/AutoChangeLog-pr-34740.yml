changes:
  - {bugfix: Shuttle control consoles can no longer be synced to shuttles if not actually
      on the shuttle.}
  - {bugfix: 'Regular non-overmap shuttle control consoles will no longer function
      on overmap shuttles, and vice-versa.'}
  - {tweak: "Shuttle control consoles now automatically sync to the shuttle they're
      built on when created, instead of needing to be set by multitooling the board
      before creation."}
