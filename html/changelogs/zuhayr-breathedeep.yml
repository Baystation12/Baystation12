changes: 
  - tweak: "Gas inhalation effects are now reagent-based. Gases create reagents inside the body, which then apply effects. This means that gaseous phoron exposure, for example, needs to be treated with dialysis/dylovene, as it fills your guts up with liquid phoron."
  - tweak: "The poison_type var on species datums is now poison_types, and determines which poison gasses show you the toxins UI indicator, rather than which ones cause poisoning. The actual effects of poisonous gasses is determined by the reagent value (as per dexalin being injected into a vox, etc.). This really shouldn't impact anything for the average player, except that chlorine and nitrogen dioxide (not N2O, for clarity) are now actually poisonous."
  - tweak: "Helium now makes your voice squeaky. Very important feature."
  - tweak: "Xenon is now functionally the same as N2O, including the following note."
  - tweak: "N2O now causes giggling, confusion, dizziness and occasional passing out at high dosages, rather than instant and immediate knockout. Still useful for riot control and now flooding it into distro isn't a round-ender. You might even be able to use it without admins shouting at you! Refer to the optable neural suppressor PR for a replacement method to sedate people for surgery."
  - tweak: "Finally, as a sidenote, Bogani will actually be poisoned by oxygen and chlorine will have a visible overlay now."
