changes: 
  - rscadd: "Unathi have three new organs, the Mogendrix, which aids with blood regeneration,  the Cardioasylant, which may restart the heart after cardiac arrest and the Air Sack, a fragile lung equvialent."
  - tweak: "Unathi's Brute Mod has been moved into Armor. Guns and E-Swords hurt them just fine, now."
  - tweak: "Unathi require more oxygen to survive than a human- 20 kpa partial pressure, compared to 16."
  - tweak: "Unathi have stronger heads, and 50% more brain health."
  - tweak: "Replacement Organs for Unathi are markedly more expensive in the Bioprinter."
  - rscadd: "Adds Mogine, a reagent that regenerates blood much like Nanoblood, but far less effective. Made by the Mogendrix. You can steal it from them."
  - rscadd: "Unathi take longer to build up a bad case of Radiation."
  - rscadd: "Unathi can now pick more than just their home clan as a Faction."
  - tweak: "Yeosa'Unathi's unique bite has been revamped- Now injects a mild neurotoxin, instead of damaging the liver directly."
  - rscadd: "Adds Venomous Ichor, Yeosa'Unathi's unique venom. Causes bradychardia, and is a modest painkiller while being a weak toxin."
  - tweak: "Unathi Regen has been nerfed into the ground and is much less effective now, effectively only healing paper cuts in reasonable time."
