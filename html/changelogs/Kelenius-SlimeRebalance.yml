changes: 
  - tweak: "Slimes will always imprint on those who feed them to avoid long streaks of bad luck."
  - tweak: "RNG removed from the feeding: slimes now always get 20 nutrition per 5 clone damage."
  - tweak: "Slime nutrition drain reduced."
  - tweak: "Added a small delay between the slime latch and the first damage dealt."
  - tweak: "Changed how slimes react to damage. Slimes that are attacked with something will sometimes be shaken off their victims (chance is force * 5 - anything with force or 20 or above is a guaranteed shake-off)."
  - tweak: "Disarming a slime or wrestling them off now has a chance to disorient them for a moment. Throwing them off with a weapon doesn't do that."
  - tweak: "Water will make slimes lose their target, stop feeding, and will disorient them for a moment on the first application (they will not be stunlocked and repeated applications have no effect)."
  - tweak: "Slimes now twice as weak to water - PLEASE remember that spraying them more than once is a waste, the water is already on them and killing them."
  - bugfix: "Fixed a bug where slime's nutrition was always maxed out when they fed, causing them to evolve and split instantly."
  - bugfix: "Slimes now guaranteed to have unique numbers."
  - bugfix: "Fixed an issue with monkey cubes not deleting in sinks."
  - bugfix: "Fixed a bug where a slime's location sometimes wouldn't update while they were feeding."
