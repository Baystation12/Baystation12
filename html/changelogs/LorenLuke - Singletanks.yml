delete-after: True

changes: 
  - rscdel: "Got rid of the awful singletank code."
  - rscadd: "Rupturing and exploding tanks (including TTVs) now create shrapnel."
  - rscadd: "Created new singletank logic for its construction usage and disassembly (see below)."
  - tweak: "Added relief valve to air tanks. They now trigger leak logic at over 173C (don't get it too hot, kiddies!). Can be welded shut to prevent leakage."
  - tweak: "Single Tank devices must be wired before having assemblies attached."
  - tweak: "Single tank devices are single use only with their igniters. The igniters create a small bit of heat, which may hopefully be enough to get fuelt to its burn temperature (126C)."
  - tweak: "Air from rupturing/exploding tanks now merged into environment instead of deleted."
  - tweak: "Explosion radii based on pressure and gas amount in a rupturing vessel."
