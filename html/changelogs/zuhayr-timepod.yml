changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added a crashed escape pod that may generate on exoplanets and allow for latejoiners a la Bearcat."
  - tweak: "Some ruins and submaps will add themselves to the distress signal list. Probably worth checking now."
  - rscdel: "Prevented submap jobs from being test-spawned by the global datum system as they do not expect null args."
