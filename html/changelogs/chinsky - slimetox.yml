  - tweak: "Slimetoxin. Slimetoxin changed. Instead of pop and go slimeficiation it's now a life threatening process. Slime toxin metabolizes slowly, and deals fair bit of toxins damage. For every unit or so metabolized, it mutates one limb. Once every limb mutated, there's a 10% every tick to fully mutate into a slimegirl. If you're lucky, you might mutate right before death and that'd heal your all wounds! That' a great idea!"
