changes: 
  - bugfix: "Emotes ending in quotation marks will no longer add a superfluous period on the end."
  - bugfix: "Lazy typists rejoice! When speaking, the game will automatically capitalize and add punctuation where needed. Well at least on the end of the sentence."
  - tweak: "Emotes now use the visible emote character set in your Character Setup, which defaults to \"^\"."
