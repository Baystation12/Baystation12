  - tweak: "Autopilot default speed lowered from 2 (Exceeds max speed hardcap of 0.1) to 0.0025 (40 seconds ETA per tile)"
  - bugfix: "Autopilot no longer burns fuel needlessly bouncing above/below the speedlimit, and will now never go above the speedlimit."
  - tweak: "Autopilot now handles changing direction/destination and diagonal movement much more efficiently fuel wise"
  - bugfix: "It is once again possible to decelerate to a speed of 0."
