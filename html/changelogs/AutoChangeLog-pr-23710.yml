changes: 
  - balance: "EMPs now deal much less damage to synthetic humans (FBP, IPC), though the amount is still considerable."
  - balance: "Damaged robotic legs and feet reduce movement speed."
  - balance: "Robotic external organs will, if heavily damaged or the damage taken is large, pass burn damage to contained internal organs."
  - tweak: "Cell organs are dramatically less power-efficient if damaged."
  - tweak: "If a synthetic human runs out of juice, they become unconscious."
