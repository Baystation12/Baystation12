  Kelenius:
  - rscadd: 'Good news to the roboticists! The long waited firmware update for the
      bots has arrived. You can expect the following changes:'
  - rscadd: Medbots have improved the disease detection algorithms.
  - rscadd: Floorbot firmware has been bugtested. In particular, they will no longer
      get stuck near the windows, hopelessly trying to fix the floor under the glass.
  - rscadd: Floorbots have also received an internal low-power metal synthesizer.
      They will use it to make their own tiles. Slowly.
  - rscadd: Following the complains from humanitarian organizations regarding securitron
      brutality, stength of their stunners has been toned down. They will also politely
      demand that you get on the floor before arresting you. Except for the taser-mounted
      guys, they will still tase you down.
  - rscadd: Other minor fixes.
  - rscdel: 'The lasertag bots are now forbidden to build and use following the incident
      #1526672. Please don''t let it happen again.'
  - rscadd: The farmbot design has been finished! Made from a watertank, robot arm,
      plant analyzer, bucket, minihoe and a proximity sensor, these small (not really)
      bots will be a useful companion to any gardener and/or xenobotanist.
  - tweak: 'Spider learning alert: they have learned to recognize the bots and will
      mercilessly attack them.'
  - rscadd: An experimental CPU upgrade would theoretically allow any of the bots
      to function with the same intelligence capacity as the maintenance drones. We
      still have no idea what causes it to boot up. Science!
  - rscadd: 'INCOMING TRANSMISSION: Greetings to agents, pirates, operatives, and
      anyone who otherwise uses our equipment. Following the NT update of bot firmware,
      we have updated the cryptographic sequencer''s hacking routines as well. The
      medbots you emag will not poison you anymore, the clanbots won''t clean after
      themselves immediately, and floorbots... wear a space suit. Oh, and it works
      on the new farmbots, too.'

      cosmetic items, shoes, hats, and all things that do not provide a straight advtange
      (sterile mask, or pAI, protection from viruses and possible door hacking or
      records access, respectively), each cost 1 point, items that provide an advantage
      like those just mentioned, or provide armor or storage cost 2 points.
  - rscadd: Adds practice rounds, both .45 for Sec and Detective's guns, also 9mm
      top mounted for the Saber, and for the Bulldog.
  - rscadd: Adds the .45 and 9mm practice rounds to the armory.

  HarpyEagle:
  - rscadd: 'Added new fire modes to various guns: c20r, STS-35, WT-550, Z8, L6 SAW,
      and double barreled shotgun. The firing modes work the same way as the egun;
      click on the weapon with it in your active hand to cycle between modes. Unloading

      send emergency messages and make announcements.
  - rscadd: Adds an emergency bluespace relay machine which is mapped into teletcomms,
      this machine takes emergency messages and sends them to central, if one does
      not exist on any Z, you cannot send any emergency messages.
  - rscadd: Adds an emergency bluespace relay assembly kit orderable from cargo for
      when the ones on telecomms are destroyed. Assembly is required.

      in.
2015-05-16:
  GinjaNinja32:
  - rscadd: Rewrote tables. To construct a table, use steel to make a table frame,
      then plate the frame with a material such as steel, gold, wood, etc. Hold a
      stack in your hand and drag it to the table to reinforce it. To deconstruct
      a table, use a screwdriver to remove the reinforcements (if present), then a
      wrench to remove the plating, and a wrench again to dismantle the frame. Use
      a welder to repair any damage. Use a carpet tile on a table to add felt, and
      a crowbar to remove it.
  HarpyEagle:
  - rscadd: Adds tail animations for tajaran and unathi. Animations are controlled
      using emotes.

  - tweak: Reagents now differentiate between being ingested (food, pills, smoke),
      injected (syringes, IV drips), and put on the skin (sprays, beaker splashing).
  - tweak: Injecting food and drinks will cause bad effects.
  - tweak: Healing reagents, generally speaking, have stronger effects when injected.
  - tweak: Toxins now work slower and deal more damage. Seek medical help!

  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: Destroying a camera by brute force now has a chance to break the wiring
      within.
  - rscadd: Turf are now processed. This, for example, causes radioactive walls to
      regularly irradiate nearby mobs.

  - bugfix: Goats will eat the spawning plants for vines as well as the vines themselves.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Ghetto diagnosis. Grab patient, aim at bodypart you want to check, click
      on them with help intent. This will tell you about their wounds, fractures and
      other oddities (toxins/oxygen) for that bodypart.
  - rscadd: Fractures are visible on very damaged limbs. Dislocations are always visible.
      Surgery incisions now visible too.

  - rscadd: Re-implemented fuel fires. Tweaked fire behaviour overall.
  Yoshax:
  - tweak: Bear traps now do damage when stood on, enough to break bones! Bear traps
      can now affect any limb of a person who is on the ground, including head! Bear
      traps are no longer legcuffs and instead embed in the limb they attack.
  - tweak: Bear traps now take several seconds to deploy and cannot be picked up when
      armed, they must be disarmed by clicking on them. They also cannot be moved
      then they are deployed.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Massive material refactor. Walls, beds, chairs, stools, tables, ashtrays,
      knives, baseball bats, axes, simple doors, barricades, so on.
  - rscadd: Tables are now built via steel then another sheet on the resulting frame.
      They can then be reinforced by dragging a stack of sheets onto the table.
  - rscadd: Walls are built with steel for girders, then right-click the girder and
      select the reinforce verb while holding a stack, then click the girders with
      a final sheet.
  - rscadd: Various things can be built with various sheet types. Experiment! Just
      keep in mind that uranium is now radioactive and phoron is now flammable.
2015-05-26:
  Atlantis:
  - rscadd: NanoUI for Robotics Control Console
  - rscadd: NanoUI for Supermatter Crystal - AI/Robot only, purely informational
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Meat limbs now can be attached. Use limb on missing area, then hemostat
      to finalize it.
  - rscadd: Limbs from other races can be now attached. They'll cause rejection, but
      it can be kept at bay with spaceacilline to some point. Species special attack
      is carried over too, i.e. you can clawn people if you sew a cathand to yourself.
  - rscadd: Limbs that are left in open will rot in ~7 minutes. Use freezers or cryobags
      to stop it. You can still attach them, but you wish you couldn't.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: Both the pulse taker and target must now remain still for the duration
      of the check or it will fail.
  RavingManiac:
  - rscadd: Tape recorders now record hearable emotes and action messages (e.g. gunshots).
  - bugfix: You can now see actions from inside mechs and closets.
  Techhead:
  - rscadd: Removed gaseous reagents from the chemistry system and replaced with real-world
      organic chemistry precursors.
  - rscadd: Hydrogen has been replaced with hydrazine, a highly toxic, flammable liquid.
  - rscadd: Oxygen has been replaced with acetone, a mildly toxic liquid. Ethanol's
      ink-sovlent capabilities have been copied to it.
  - rscadd: Chlorine has been replaced with hydrochloric acid. It is a stronger acid
      than sulphuric but less toxic.
  - tweak: Nitrogen has been replaced with ammonia. Ammonia now acts as a Dexalin-equivalent
      for Vox.
  - tweak: Flourine has also been replaced with hydrazine in its one recipe. Flourosurficant
      has been renamed azosurficant.
  - tweak: Being splashed with liquid Phoron will burn eyes and contaminate clothes
      like being exposed to Phoron gas.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Added a ghost requisition system for posibrains and living plants.
  - rscadd: Added attack_ghost() to hydro trays and posibrains to allow ghosts to
      enter them.
  - rscadd: Prosthetic limbs are now only repairable with welders/cable coils if they
      have suffered below 30 combined damage.
  - rscadd: 'Surgery steps that cause no pain and have no failure wounding have been
      added: screwdriver for ''incision'', crowbar to open, multitool to ''decouple''
      a prosthetic organ. Hemostat is still used to take an organ out.'
  - rscadd: Using a welder or a cable coil as a surgical tool after opening a maintenance
      hatch will repair damage beyond the 30 damage cap. In other words, severe damage
      to robolimbs requires expert repair from someone else.
  - rscdel: Eye and brain surgery were removed; they predate the current organ system
      and are redundant.
  - rscadd: IPC are now simply full prosthetic bodies using a specific manufacturer
      (Morpheus Cyberkinetics).
  - rscadd: IPC can 'recharge' in a cyborg station to regain nutriment. They no longer
      interface with APCs.
  - rscadd: NO_BLOOD flag now bypasses ingested and blood reagent processing.
  - rscadd: NO_SCAN now bypasses mutagen reagent effects.
  - rscadd: Cyborg analyzers now show damage to prosthetic limbs and organs on humans.
  - tweak: Prosthetic EMP damage was reduced.
  - tweak: Several organ files were split up/moved around.
2015-05-27:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: The inactive check process now respects client holder status and can be
      configured how long clients may remain inactive before being kicked.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Unfolded pAIs can now be scooped up and worn as hats.
  - tweak: Scoop-up behavior is now standardized to selecting help intent and dragging
      their icon onto yours.
2015-05-30:
  Atlantis:
  - rscadd: Malfunction Overhaul - Whole gamemode was completely reworked from scratch.
      Most old abilities have been removed and quite a lot of new abilities was added.
      AI also has to hack APCs to unlock higher tier abilities faster, instead of
      having access to them from the round start. Most forced things, such as, shuttle
      recalling were removed and are instead controlled by the AI. Code is fully modular
      allowing for future modifications.
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixes Engineer ERT gloves not being insulated.
  - tweak: IV stands are no longer bullet shields. They also allow mice, drones, pAIs
      et al to pass though.
  Kelenius:
  - tweak: AI now hears LOOC both around its eye and its core, and speaks in LOOC
      around its eye. Keep in mind that you won't hear and won't be heard if there
      is a wall between your eye and the target.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: You can now review the server revision date and hash by using the 'Show
      Server Revision' verb in the OOC category.

  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: AI eyes can now be found in the observer follow list.
  - rscadd: Synths can now review all law modules that can be found on the station
      from their law manager.
  - rscadd: Synths can state these laws if desired, however this is strongly discouraged
      unless subverted/malfunctioning.
  - bugfix: Astral projecting mobs, such as wizards or cultists, may no longer respawn
      as something else while their body lives.
  Techhead:
  - rscadd: Prison break event has been expanded to include Virology or Xenobiology
  - rscadd: Prison break event will warn Enginering and the AI beforehand so they
      can take preventive measures.
  - bugfix: Disabling area power will now prevent doors from opening during the event
2015-06-05:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - bugfix: Split stacks no longer lose their coloring.
  - tweak: Can no longer merge cables of different colors.
  - tweak: Blobs and simple mobs now attack all external organs instead of a subset.
      The overall damage remains the same but the number of fractures caused will,
      in general, be fewer.
  - rscadd: Spider nurses now have a chance of injecting their victims with spider
      eggs which eventually hatch. If the limb is removed from the host, the host
      dies, or the spiderling has matured sufficiently it will crawl out into freedom.
      Medical scanners will pick upp eggs and spiderlings as foreign bodies.
  Yoshax:
  - tweak: Makes hyposprays start empty instead of filled with Tricord.
  - tweak: Makes the special wizard projectile staffs, Animate, Change, Focus and
      any future ones only usable by wizards. Also makes it so only wizards can use
      spellbooks and teleportation scrolls.
2015-06-08:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: The AI chassis now glows, with the color depending on the currently selected
      display.
2015-06-09:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: Ports /tg/'s meteor event. Meteors now appear to be more accurate, come
      in a greater variety, and may drop ores on their final destruction.
2015-06-16:
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: 'Updated penlights to be more of use in diagnostics, they now show following
      conditions:'
  - rscadd: Eye damage
  - rscadd: Blurry eyes (overall slower reaction)
  - rscadd: Brain damage (one eye reacts slower)
  - rscadd: Opiates use (pinpoint pupils)
  - rscadd: Drugs use (dilated pupils)
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: Observers can now follow both the AI and its eye upon speech.
  - rscadd: Observers can now follow both observers and their body, if they ever had
      one, upon speech.
  - rscadd: Observers can now follow hivemind speakers if the speaker is not using
      an alias or antagHUD is enabled.
  - rscadd: Turret controls now glow, with the color depending on the current mode.
  Techhead:
  - rscadd: Converted Request Console interface into NanoUI.
2015-06-19:

      Mob fires also burn hotter.
  - rscadd: Matches can now be used to light things adjacent to you when thrown.
  - tweak: Made the effects of having a damaged robotic leg more prominent.
  - bugfix: Robot limbs no longer cause pain messages. A reminder that you can still
      check their status with 'Help Intent' -> 'Click Self'.
  - tweak: Knifing damage scales with weapon force and throat protection. Helmets
      only provide throat protection if they are air tight. Trying to cut someone's
      throat with wirecutters and/or while wearing an armoured sealed helmet will
      require several attempts before the victim passes out.
  - tweak: Knifing switches on harm intent, in case you just wanted to beat on the
      victim for some reason.
  - bugfix: Prevents knifing bots or silicons.
2015-06-22:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: The traitor uplink no longer displays all items in a long list, instead
      has categories which when accessed shows the relevant items.
2015-06-24:
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixed Tajaran name generation producing names without a space between
      first and last.
  - wip: Adds docking to the mercenary shuttle. Works similarly to other shuttles,
      except docking and undocking is manually initiated and not automatic. A system
      to approve or deny dock requests still to be implemented.
  - rscadd: Toolboxes can now hold larger items, such as stacks of metal or power
      cells, at the cost of having less space for other things.
  - tweak: Gloves/shoes can now be worn even if you have one hand/foot missing. The
      other one still has to be present, of course. The items still drop when you
      first lose the hand/foot.
  - tweak: Budget insulated gloves are somewhat less useless. On average, they will
      stop half the damage from getting shocked, and the worst case insulation is
      not as bad as it used to be. Budget gloves that are as good as regular insulated
      gloves are still as rare as they were before though.
  - tweak: PTR bullets are now hitscan, to make them somewhat better for actual sniping.
  - maptweak: The telecoms server room now has an actual cycling airlock into it.
  - tweak: Non-vital body parts will no longer take further damage above a certain
      amount, and will inflict paincrit effects instead. On most humaniods the head,
      chest, and groin are vital.
  - rscadd: 'Engineers now spawn with industrial workboots (credit: ChessPiece/Bishop).'
  - bugfix: Damaged robotic legs now more likely to have an effect.
  - bugfix: Fixed bug preventing internal organs from taking damage in some cases.
  - maptweak: New flavours of tables around the station. Engineering starts with more
      plastic.
  - bugfix: Fixed worn items not appearing in some cases. Most notably crossbows and
      certain guns when worn on the back. As a side effect, laundry machines no longer
      transform items.
  - bugfix: Crit oxyloss now runs in game time instead of real time. So if lag is
      slowing your movement the same slowdown applies to the dying person you're trying
      to reach.
  - rscadd: Breathmasks can now be adjusted by clicking on them in your hand, in addition
      to the verb.
  - rscadd: Wearing a space helmet or similar face-covering gear now prevents eating
      and force-feeding food, drink, and pills.
  - rscadd: Phoron in air ignites above it's flashpoint temperature and a certain
      (very small) minimum concentration. Environments that have oxygen and are hot
      enough, and have phoron but not enough concentration to burn will produce flareouts,
      which are mostly a visual effect.
  - rscadd: Adds animation when making unarmed attacks or attacking with melee weapons,
      to help make it clearer who is attacking.
  - soundadd: Opening an unpowered door now has an appropriate sound.
  - rscadd: Ingesting diseased blood may contract the disease.
2015-06-26: {}
2015-06-30:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - maptweak: Non-general areas on Crescent are now protected by blast doors to enforce
      area restrictions. Admins can operate these from the central checkpoint.
2015-07-04:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: Portable turrets now only blocks movement while deployed.
  - tweak: Portable turrets are no longer invincible while undeployed, however they
      have increased damage resistance in this state.
  - bugfix: Crescent portable turrets should no longer act up during attempts to (un)wrench
      and alter their settings.
2015-07-06:
  GinjaNinja32:
  - rscadd: '''Provisional'' is now also a valid temporary position prefix for manifest
      sorting.'
2015-07-10:
