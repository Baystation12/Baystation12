  - tweak: Some maintenance doors within RnD and Medbay have had their accesses changed.
      Maintenance doors in the joint areas (leading to the research shuttle, virology,
      and xenobiology) are now zero access. Which means anyone in those joints can
      enter the maintenance tunnels. This was done to add additional evacuation locations
      during radiation storms. Additional maintenance doors were added to the tunnels
      in these areas to prevent docs and scientists from running about.
  - tweak: Starboard emergency storage isn't gone now, it's simply located in the
      escape wing.
  - experiment: An engineering training room has been added to engineering. This location
      was previously where surgery was located. If you are new to engineering or need
      to brush up on your skills, please use this area for testing.

      with the shotgun.
  - bugfix: Portable air pumps now fill based on external/airtank pressure when pumping
      in.
2015-05-16:
  GinjaNinja32:
  - rscadd: Rewrote tables. To construct a table, use steel to make a table frame,
      then plate the frame with a material such as steel, gold, wood, etc. Hold a
      stack in your hand and drag it to the table to reinforce it. To deconstruct
      a table, use a screwdriver to remove the reinforcements (if present), then a
      wrench to remove the plating, and a wrench again to dismantle the frame. Use
      a welder to repair any damage. Use a carpet tile on a table to add felt, and
      a crowbar to remove it.
  HarpyEagle:

      injected (syringes, IV drips), and put on the skin (sprays, beaker splashing).
  - tweak: Injecting food and drinks will cause bad effects.
  - tweak: Healing reagents, generally speaking, have stronger effects when injected.

  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: Destroying a camera by brute force now has a chance to break the wiring
      within.
  - rscadd: Turf are now processed. This, for example, causes radioactive walls to
      regularly irradiate nearby mobs.

  - bugfix: Goats will eat the spawning plants for vines as well as the vines themselves.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Ghetto diagnosis. Grab patient, aim at bodypart you want to check, click
      on them with help intent. This will tell you about their wounds, fractures and
      other oddities (toxins/oxygen) for that bodypart.
  - rscadd: Fractures are visible on very damaged limbs. Dislocations are always visible.
      Surgery incisions now visible too.

  - rscadd: Re-implemented fuel fires. Tweaked fire behaviour overall.
  Yoshax:
  - tweak: Bear traps now do damage when stood on, enough to break bones! Bear traps
      can now affect any limb of a person who is on the ground, including head! Bear
      traps are no longer legcuffs and instead embed in the limb they attack.
  - tweak: Bear traps now take several seconds to deploy and cannot be picked up when
      armed, they must be disarmed by clicking on them. They also cannot be moved
      then they are deployed.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Massive material refactor. Walls, beds, chairs, stools, tables, ashtrays,
      knives, baseball bats, axes, simple doors, barricades, so on.
  - rscadd: Tables are now built via steel then another sheet on the resulting frame.
      They can then be reinforced by dragging a stack of sheets onto the table.
  - rscadd: Walls are built with steel for girders, then right-click the girder and
      select the reinforce verb while holding a stack, then click the girders with
      a final sheet.
  - rscadd: Various things can be built with various sheet types. Experiment! Just
      keep in mind that uranium is now radioactive and phoron is now flammable.
2015-05-26:
  Atlantis:
  - rscadd: NanoUI for Robotics Control Console
  - rscadd: NanoUI for Supermatter Crystal - AI/Robot only, purely informational
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Meat limbs now can be attached. Use limb on missing area, then hemostat
      to finalize it.
  - rscadd: Limbs from other races can be now attached. They'll cause rejection, but
      it can be kept at bay with spaceacilline to some point. Species special attack
      is carried over too, i.e. you can clawn people if you sew a cathand to yourself.
  - rscadd: Limbs that are left in open will rot in ~7 minutes. Use freezers or cryobags
      to stop it. You can still attach them, but you wish you couldn't.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: Both the pulse taker and target must now remain still for the duration
      of the check or it will fail.
  RavingManiac:
  - rscadd: Tape recorders now record hearable emotes and action messages (e.g. gunshots).
  - bugfix: You can now see actions from inside mechs and closets.
  Techhead:
  - rscadd: Removed gaseous reagents from the chemistry system and replaced with real-world
      organic chemistry precursors.
  - rscadd: Hydrogen has been replaced with hydrazine, a highly toxic, flammable liquid.
  - rscadd: Oxygen has been replaced with acetone, a mildly toxic liquid. Ethanol's
      ink-sovlent capabilities have been copied to it.
  - rscadd: Chlorine has been replaced with hydrochloric acid. It is a stronger acid
      than sulphuric but less toxic.
  - tweak: Nitrogen has been replaced with ammonia. Ammonia now acts as a Dexalin-equivalent
      for Vox.
  - tweak: Flourine has also been replaced with hydrazine in its one recipe. Flourosurficant
      has been renamed azosurficant.
  - tweak: Being splashed with liquid Phoron will burn eyes and contaminate clothes
      like being exposed to Phoron gas.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Added a ghost requisition system for posibrains and living plants.
  - rscadd: Added attack_ghost() to hydro trays and posibrains to allow ghosts to
      enter them.
  - rscadd: Prosthetic limbs are now only repairable with welders/cable coils if they
      have suffered below 30 combined damage.
  - rscadd: 'Surgery steps that cause no pain and have no failure wounding have been
      added: screwdriver for ''incision'', crowbar to open, multitool to ''decouple''
      a prosthetic organ. Hemostat is still used to take an organ out.'
  - rscadd: Using a welder or a cable coil as a surgical tool after opening a maintenance
      hatch will repair damage beyond the 30 damage cap. In other words, severe damage
      to robolimbs requires expert repair from someone else.
  - rscdel: Eye and brain surgery were removed; they predate the current organ system
      and are redundant.
  - rscadd: IPC are now simply full prosthetic bodies using a specific manufacturer
      (Morpheus Cyberkinetics).
  - rscadd: IPC can 'recharge' in a cyborg station to regain nutriment. They no longer
      interface with APCs.
  - rscadd: NO_BLOOD flag now bypasses ingested and blood reagent processing.
  - rscadd: NO_SCAN now bypasses mutagen reagent effects.
  - rscadd: Cyborg analyzers now show damage to prosthetic limbs and organs on humans.

  - rscadd: Unfolded pAIs can now be scooped up and worn as hats.
  - tweak: Scoop-up behavior is now standardized to selecting help intent and dragging
      their icon onto yours.
2015-05-30:
  Atlantis:
  - rscadd: Malfunction Overhaul - Whole gamemode was completely reworked from scratch.
      Most old abilities have been removed and quite a lot of new abilities was added.
      AI also has to hack APCs to unlock higher tier abilities faster, instead of
      having access to them from the round start. Most forced things, such as, shuttle
      recalling were removed and are instead controlled by the AI. Code is fully modular
      allowing for future modifications.
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixes Engineer ERT gloves not being insulated.
  - tweak: IV stands are no longer bullet shields. They also allow mice, drones, pAIs
      et al to pass though.
  Kelenius:
  - tweak: AI now hears LOOC both around its eye and its core, and speaks in LOOC
      around its eye. Keep in mind that you won't hear and won't be heard if there
      is a wall between your eye and the target.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: You can now review the server revision date and hash by using the 'Show
      Server Revision' verb in the OOC category.

      unless subverted/malfunctioning.
  - bugfix: Astral projecting mobs, such as wizards or cultists, may no longer respawn
      as something else while their body lives.
  Techhead:
  - rscadd: Prison break event has been expanded to include Virology or Xenobiology
  - rscadd: Prison break event will warn Enginering and the AI beforehand so they
      can take preventive measures.
  - bugfix: Disabling area power will now prevent doors from opening during the event
2015-06-05:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - bugfix: Split stacks no longer lose their coloring.
  - tweak: Can no longer merge cables of different colors.
  - tweak: Blobs and simple mobs now attack all external organs instead of a subset.
      The overall damage remains the same but the number of fractures caused will,
      in general, be fewer.
  - rscadd: Spider nurses now have a chance of injecting their victims with spider
      eggs which eventually hatch. If the limb is removed from the host, the host
      dies, or the spiderling has matured sufficiently it will crawl out into freedom.
      Medical scanners will pick upp eggs and spiderlings as foreign bodies.
  Yoshax:
  - tweak: Makes hyposprays start empty instead of filled with Tricord.
  - tweak: Makes the special wizard projectile staffs, Animate, Change, Focus and
      any future ones only usable by wizards. Also makes it so only wizards can use
      spellbooks and teleportation scrolls.
2015-06-08:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: The AI chassis now glows, with the color depending on the currently selected
      display.
2015-06-09:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: Ports /tg/'s meteor event. Meteors now appear to be more accurate, come
      in a greater variety, and may drop ores on their final destruction.
2015-06-16:
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: 'Updated penlights to be more of use in diagnostics, they now show following
      conditions:'
  - rscadd: Eye damage
  - rscadd: Blurry eyes (overall slower reaction)
  - rscadd: Brain damage (one eye reacts slower)
  - rscadd: Opiates use (pinpoint pupils)
  - rscadd: Drugs use (dilated pupils)
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: Observers can now follow both the AI and its eye upon speech.
  - rscadd: Observers can now follow both observers and their body, if they ever had
      one, upon speech.

  Techhead:
  - rscadd: Converted Request Console interface into NanoUI.
2015-06-19:
  HarpyEagle:

      Mob fires also burn hotter.
  - rscadd: Matches can now be used to light things adjacent to you when thrown.
  - tweak: Made the effects of having a damaged robotic leg more prominent.
  - bugfix: Robot limbs no longer cause pain messages. A reminder that you can still
      check their status with 'Help Intent' -> 'Click Self'.
  - tweak: Knifing damage scales with weapon force and throat protection. Helmets
      only provide throat protection if they are air tight. Trying to cut someone's
      throat with wirecutters and/or while wearing an armoured sealed helmet will
      require several attempts before the victim passes out.
  - tweak: Knifing switches on harm intent, in case you just wanted to beat on the
      victim for some reason.
  - bugfix: Prevents knifing bots or silicons.
2015-06-22:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: The traitor uplink no longer displays all items in a long list, instead
      has categories which when accessed shows the relevant items.
2015-06-24:
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixed Tajaran name generation producing names without a space between
      first and last.
  - wip: Adds docking to the mercenary shuttle. Works similarly to other shuttles,
      except docking and undocking is manually initiated and not automatic. A system
      to approve or deny dock requests still to be implemented.
  - rscadd: Toolboxes can now hold larger items, such as stacks of metal or power
      cells, at the cost of having less space for other things.
  - tweak: Gloves/shoes can now be worn even if you have one hand/foot missing. The
      other one still has to be present, of course. The items still drop when you
      first lose the hand/foot.
  - tweak: Budget insulated gloves are somewhat less useless. On average, they will
      stop half the damage from getting shocked, and the worst case insulation is
      not as bad as it used to be. Budget gloves that are as good as regular insulated
      gloves are still as rare as they were before though.
  - tweak: PTR bullets are now hitscan, to make them somewhat better for actual sniping.
  - maptweak: The telecoms server room now has an actual cycling airlock into it.
  - tweak: Non-vital body parts will no longer take further damage above a certain
      amount, and will inflict paincrit effects instead. On most humaniods the head,
      chest, and groin are vital.
  - rscadd: 'Engineers now spawn with industrial workboots (credit: ChessPiece/Bishop).'
  - bugfix: Damaged robotic legs now more likely to have an effect.
  - bugfix: Fixed bug preventing internal organs from taking damage in some cases.
  - maptweak: New flavours of tables around the station. Engineering starts with more
      plastic.
  - bugfix: Fixed worn items not appearing in some cases. Most notably crossbows and
      certain guns when worn on the back. As a side effect, laundry machines no longer
      transform items.
  - bugfix: Crit oxyloss now runs in game time instead of real time. So if lag is
      slowing your movement the same slowdown applies to the dying person you're trying
      to reach.
  - rscadd: Breathmasks can now be adjusted by clicking on them in your hand, in addition
      to the verb.
  - rscadd: Wearing a space helmet or similar face-covering gear now prevents eating
      and force-feeding food, drink, and pills.
  - rscadd: Phoron in air ignites above it's flashpoint temperature and a certain
      (very small) minimum concentration. Environments that have oxygen and are hot
      enough, and have phoron but not enough concentration to burn will produce flareouts,
      which are mostly a visual effect.
  - rscadd: Adds animation when making unarmed attacks or attacking with melee weapons,
      to help make it clearer who is attacking.
  - soundadd: Opening an unpowered door now has an appropriate sound.
  - rscadd: Ingesting diseased blood may contract the disease.

      area restrictions. Admins can operate these from the central checkpoint.
2015-07-04:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: Portable turrets now only blocks movement while deployed.
  - tweak: Portable turrets are no longer invincible while undeployed, however they
      have increased damage resistance in this state.
  - bugfix: Crescent portable turrets should no longer act up during attempts to (un)wrench
      and alter their settings.
2015-07-06:
  GinjaNinja32:

  - tweak: Wizards can no longer etheral jaunt unto turfs that contain solid objects.
2015-07-27:
  Kelenius:
  - tweak: Borg shaker now works similarly to hypospray. It generates reagents that
      can be poured into glasses.
  - bugfix: Therefore, they can no longer duplicate rare reagents such as phoron.
2015-07-29:
  Karolis2011:
  - rscadd: Made tagger and sorting pipes dispensible.
  - bugfix: Unwelding and welding sorting/tagger pipes, no longer delete data about
      them.
2015-07-31:
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixed projectiles being able to hit people in body parts that they don't
      have. This will also mean that the less limbs someone has the less effective
      they will be as a body shield.
2015-08-11:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - experiment: 0.1.19 is live.
  - tweak: Crew monitors now update every 5th second instead of every other. Reduces
      lag and gives antags a larger window of opportunity to disable suit sensors
      if they have to harm someone.
2015-08-13:
  GinjaNinja32:
  - rscadd: Changed language selection to allow multiple language selections, changed
      humans/unathi/tajarans/skrell to not automatically gain their racial language,
      instead adding it to the selectable languages for that species. Old slots will
      warn when loaded that the languages may not be what you expect.
  Orelbon:
  - rscadd: Changed the HoP's suit to more bibrant colors and hopefully you will like
      it.
2015-08-14:
  HarpyEagle:
  - spellcheck: Renames many guns to follow a consistent naming style. Updated and
      changed gun description text to be more lore-friendly.
  - rscadd: Throwing a booze bottle at something nearby while on harm intent causes
      it to smash, splashing it's contents over whatever it hits.
  - rscadd: Rags can now be wrung out over a container or the floor, emptying it's
      contents into the container or splashing them on the floor.
  - rscadd: Rags can now be soaked using the large water and fuel tanks instead of
      just beakers.
  - rscadd: Rags soaked in welding fuel can be lit on fire.

      stuffed rag is dropped onto the ground.
  - bugfix: Fixed eggs having a ridiculously large chemical volume.
  - rscadd: T-Ray scanner effects are now only visible to the person holding the scanner.
  - rscadd: Traitors can now purchase the C-20r and the STS-35 for telecrystals.
  PsiOmegaDelta:

  - rscadd: Paper can now be crumpled by using in-hand while on hurt intent.
  - rscadd: Library Computer External Archive is now sortable.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Click a hat on a drone with help intent to equip it. Drag the drone onto
      yourself with grab intent to remove it.
2015-08-15:
  Kelenius:
  - rscadd: Bees have been updated and are totally worth checking out (beekeeping
      crate at cargo).
  - rscdel: Sleeper consoles removed. All interaction is now done by clicking on the
      sleeper itself.
  - tweak: To put people into sleeper, you now have to click-drag people to it. Grabs
      no longer work. To exit the sleeper, move.
  - tweak: Sleeper now uses a NanoUI.
2015-08-16:
  HarpyEagle:
  - tweak: The unathi breacher is now only wearable by unathi.

  - bugfix: Mechanical traps no longer spawn in the janitor's locker.
  - rscadd: Mechanical traps can now be printed with a hacked autolathe.
  - rscadd: Adds armour penetration mechanic for projectiles and melee weapons.
  - rscadd: Laser carbines, LWAP, and shotgun now have a small amount of armour penetration,
      ballistic rifles (not SMGs) have moderate amounts, laser cannon has high armour
      penetration, and the PTR mostly ignores body armour.
  - tweak: 'Shotgun slugs and Z8/STS damage has been lowered slightly to accomodate
      for their higher penetration. In general ballistics deal less damage but have
      higher penetration than comparable laser weapons. Notable exception: X-Ray lasers
      have had their damage lowered slightly but gain very high armour penetration.'
  - rscadd: Energy swords now have very high armour penetration. Ninja blades do less
      damage but ignore armour completely.
  Kelenius:
  - experiment: Click cooldowns have been removed on pretty much everything that isn't
      an attack.
  PsiOmegaDelta:

      Master grid has few extra power lines to make it a little bit more robust against
      physical damage.
2016-06-12:
  Ccomp5950:

      be so easy to outrun.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: Vermin may now breed anywhere on the station but should also no longer
      spawn inside areas such as the atmospheric tanks.

  - rscadd: CentCom Fax, Admin Prayer, and CentCom emergency messages now prompt admins
      with a pleasing sound effect.
2016-06-20:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: EMPs now randomly set suit sensors, with strength affecting the probability
      of which mode is selected.
  - rscadd: Because suit sensors can be affected externally a multitool can now be
      used to (un)lock the controls, to for example allow re-adjusting prisoner uniforms.
  - rscadd: Because suit sensors can be locked the antag uplink now offers tools and
      services which are able to jam suit sensors in various ways.
  - rscadd: Adds random events which will garble suit sensor data.
2016-06-22:
  Asanadas:
  - tweak: Wall mounted Nanomed dispensers no longer require access to use.
  Ccomp5950:
  - bugfix: IPCs and will no longer get genetic abilities from radstorms.  Also Diona.

2016-06-28:
  Cirra/:
  - rscadd: Added a chemistry gripper for Crisis borgs.
  HarpyEagle:
  - rscadd: Adds applying pressure to body parts to reduce bleeding. With desired
      body part selected, help-intent click yourself or get an aggressive grab, then
      help-intent attack with the grab item. Each person should only be able to apply
      pressure to one body part on one person at a time, so choose wisely. Applying
      pressure will get blood on your hands.
  - rscadd: Splints and hardsuits that support broken limbs will automatically apply
      pressure.
  - rscadd: Wounds that require treatment (e.g. bandage) to stop bleeding will be
      bolded in the examine output. Wounds that will eventually stop bleeding on their
      own are not bolded.
  - tweak: Rigsuits now only support limbs when online.
  Haswell:
  - maptweak: Added NanoMed wall vendors in engineering, security, bridge, bar, arrivals
      and escape hallways, replacing mapped in medkits and medical supplies.

2016-07-03:
  Snapshot:
  - rscadd: Added Neural Laces which are an intented optional config togglable replacement
      to the cloning system. Neural laces are a mechanical backup of a character's
      memories and personality that can be exchanged between bodies.
  - rscadd: Added Neural Lace Surgery mechanic which works the same way as implant
      surgery.
  - rscadd: Added Neural Relacing Machine which will automate the procedure above
      and can be constructed through R&D.
  - tweak: Health Analyzers will show if a subject has a neural lace.
  - rscadd: Neural laces can be implanted in someone without a neural lace with a
      30% chance of taking over their body
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: The health indicator on the player GUI will now show a more detailed breakdown
      of damage to your body.
  - rscadd: Added bioprinter to Genetics and prosthetic organ fab to Robotics.
  redstryker:
  - rscadd: Adds evening gloves to the loadout, with the ability to tweak their color.
2016-07-06:
  Ccomp5950:
  - bugfix: Cleanbots will no longer obsess over dirt under doors/lockers or other
      areas they cannot access.
  Hubblenaut:
  - rscadd: Racks will automatically align their contents.
  - tweak: Tables use an invisible 8x8 grid for item placement.
  - tweak: Items spawning or placed in closets will not be pixelshifted.
  - tweak: Certain items will now always be placed centered (This is mostly reserved
      for items with sprites too big to be handy for grid placement).
  - tweak: Flips rack icon to be consistent with other sprites.
  - bugfix: Sets center_of_mass for tools and chemistry reagent containers.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: Uplink services now all spawn a proper item which can be used to trigger
      the relevant effect at a desired time, as opposed to it firing immediately.
  - tweak: The jammer item has been moved into the 'Devices and Tools' category.
  - tweak: The jammer services have been moved into the 'Services' category.

2016-07-08:
  Asanadas:
  - rscadd: Added two pairs of forensic gloves for detectives to use, ceasing their
      self-incrimination. Replacements can be found in the cargo detective crates.
  TheWelp:
  - tweak: Rebalances leap to respect handcuffs, ability to walk, etc.
  - tweak: Pariahs HP deficit has been removed (65->100), instead they are now more
      vulnerable to all types of damage.
  - rscadd: Adds missing hair color flag for regular Vox. Now you can have colorful
      dyed Vox hair! Within reason.
2016-07-09:
  HarpyEagle:
  - rscadd: Severe enough burn damage now causes one-time blood loss due to blistering
      and body fluid cook-off.
  - rscadd: Armor that provides 'bio' protection will now protect against the effects
      of slime feeding. Slimes can still glomp you, however, and are still dangerous
      even if you are wearing biohazard suits.
2016-07-12:
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Random event probabilities have been changed a bit. This is mostly noticeable
      with electrical storms, which should be less common now.
  - tweak: Electrical storm now shuts down APCs for longer duration which is controlled
      by event severity. APCs with critical flag are now affected too, but are only
      shut down for a short time in comparison to others.
  - tweak: EMPs are no longer one-hit kills for AIs - APCs with critical flag take
      reduced damage from EMPs, and AI's power restoration routine now resets the
      APC that may have been EMPed.
  - tweak: AI's power usage has been overhauled. Under the hood changes should improve
      reliability a bit and take more scenarios in consideration. The power restoration
      routine now provides better feedback to the AI if it fails, such as, whether
      the APC is broken or only discharged, etc.
  - rscadd: AI now has a Shutdown verb that can be used to reduce it's power usage
      five times. This disables AI's control, cameras, and most communications as
      if it was without power. This verb acts as a toggle, so it can be used again
      to turn yourself back on.
  - rscadd: AI now has Toggle Power Override verb that can be used to disable power
      saving mode when it loses APC power. This results in much faster discharge of
      internal capacitor, but allows you to operate as if you were powered. Can be
      toggled at any time.
2016-07-13:
  HarpyEagle:
  - tweak: Voidsuits and cyber suits are now more shock resistant, now roughly between
      hardsuits and thick clothing.
2016-07-14:
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Shield generator configuration has been tweaked. Shield generators upkeep
      power is reduced considerably (stationwide shield is approx. 1.1MW at full strength).
      Shields still use a lot of power when regenerating.
  - tweak: Shield capacitors now act as actual capacitors. Their power storage is
      2 GJ, and maximal input 4MW, as opposed to 8MJ/400kW it was now.
  - tweak: Shield generator+capacitor UI now displays in kilowatts and megawatts instead
      of watts where applicable.
2016-07-17:
  TheWelp:
  - tweak: Reduces fireloss cost of casting Dyrnwyn (30->10)
  - tweak: Reduces investment time (30 minutes -> 15)
  - tweak: Entangle is now a hand-spell.
  - rscadd: Humans can now use the *vomit emote, which causes them to vomit.
2016-07-18:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: The antag uplink now offers a shield disrupter in 'Devices and Tools'
      category. Handy for when that hull shield gets in your way.
  - rscadd: Once an emergency response team has been successfully dispatched, as opposed
      to simply requested, the emergency shuttle cannot be called for 30 minutes.
2016-07-22:
  Daranz:
  - bugfix: FixOVeins can now be used for attaching robotic organs (such as neural
      laces) in organic patients. Follow the same procedure as with normal organ transplant.
  Rymdmannen:
  - rscadd: Added department specific rubber stamps for cargo and warden.
  - maptweak: Replaced 'small rubber stamp' with corresponding new ones in cargo area
      and warden's office.
  - maptweak: Placed a 'DENIED' stamp in captain's office.
  - spellcheck: Renamed ''quartermaster's stamp'' to ''quartermaster's rubber stamp''.
  Snapshot:
  - rscadd: Moved airlock electronics, brig doors, portable canisters, and cargo computers
      over to TGUI
  - tweak: Cargo ordering computers have been completely reworked. Both the supply
      and ordering computer have been merged into one which can be logged into or
      out of by a crew member with cargo access. The computers will allow only one
      computer to be logged in as a register at a time and orders cannot be placed
      without a register active.
  - tweak: The cargo ordering system has been tweaked to allow requests even when
      there are not enough points available so that cargo can queue items into their
      cart at their discretion. Items moved to the cart can be demoted back to requests
      as well.
  - rscadd: The cargo computer now allows crew members to print a receipt of their
      requests for their onw use.
  - soundadd: Added sounds for printing from the cargo computer for more ambient sounds.
  - experiment: The cargo computer will quietly beep whenever a successful ui button
      press is completed. This is an experimental test to see if more ambience can
      be added without becoming too much of an annoyance.
  atlantiscze:
  - rscadd: Adds maintenance braces. These can be printed by research and used to
      lock down an airlock. Braces can be removed with paired keycard or maintenance
      jack tool (also available from research). Braces prevent the airlock from opening
      via any means, and absorb a lot of damage until they break off, protecting the
      airlock.
2016-07-23:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: Some antag uplink weapons now come with ammunition (and a container to
      hold them) and their price and description has been updated accordingly.
  - tweak: Buying random items from the antag uplink will no longer give you weapons
      without relevant ammunition, or ammunition for weapons you may not have.
2016-07-25:
  Superbee29:
  - rscadd: Ghosts can now see the power in a cable when examining it.
2016-07-29:
  Raptor1628:
  - tweak: Replaced Tactical Armor sprites and stats. Overall less protective.
  - rscadd: Adds new gas mask sprite.
  - tweak: Adjusted helmet and armor values. Helmets match their armors a bit more,
      but are usually more protective.
  - tweak: Adjusts armored vests for the torch and splits ballistic/ablative armor
      into vest and full-body versions.
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Add Antagonist vote can no longer be freely called by players. It can still
      be called by admins, or as an alternative to crew transfer.
  - tweak: Add Antagonist is no longer an alternative to crew transfer during Extended
      gamemode. The intention is to keep that gamemode antagonist-free, as it was
      originally intended.
  - rscadd: Players in the lobby will now see which antagonist types were added to
      the game. This is displayed below the gamemode's name in the Lobby tab.
2016-08-01:
  HarpyEagle:
  - rscadd: Emagged and traitor synths can no longer be locked down, except by physically
      cutting the lockdown wire (merely pulsing will not work).
  TheWelp:

      and aiming at their mouth.
  - rscadd: Vomitting now shoves out all the things in your stomach.
  - rscadd: Adds support for projectile vomitting being an ability of a species.
2016-08-02:

  - rscadd: Modules installed within a hardsuit will now be listed when examining
      the hardsuit control module while being held or worn, if the maintenance panel
      is open.
  Minijar:
  - rscadd: Upgrades anomaly isolation to be able to contain pretty much any dangerous
      anomalies with boroscillate windows and blast doors.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: Ion storms now also affect unslaved borgs, but not drones.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Prevented xenomorphs from taking shrapnel or breaking limbs. Buffed non-queen
      xeno weed health regen. Remember to rest to not take a heal penalty.
  - rscadd: Prevented weeds from entangling species with the NO_SLIP flag.
2016-08-06:
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Added status display icons for green, blue and delta alerts.
  - rscadd: Status displays now have coloured lights for alert icons.
  Zuhayr, GinjaNinja32, and Snapshot:
  - rscadd: Implemented full body prosthetics. Full Body prosthetics (FBPs) allow
      replacement of the entire body with cyborg components and replacement of internal
      organs with synethic or assisted counterparts. Players can create a FBP character
      by selecting full body in the limbs section of character preferences.
  - rscadd: FBPs gain the benefits of a stronger body and no longer requiring breathing,
      but are prone to overheating much like IPCs and can take pressure damage in
      space. If you play an FBP, be sure to wear a suit and cooler!
  - rscadd: IPC monitor screens are now a seperate object in the loadout menu. IPCs
      can select a variety of other heads from other prosthetic manufacturing companies
      to change their head and body appearance.
  - imageadd: IPC monitor screens have an object sprite that's synced to their mob
      sprite.
  - tweak: Rebalanced IPC brute and burn modifiers due to the introduction of FBPs.
      These settings may be tweaked again in the future after gameplay has been conducted.
2016-08-07:
  Asanadas:
  - bugfix: 'Brings an end to the deadly feud between two of the Exodus''s mascots:
      Pun pun, and Officer Beepsky.'
2016-08-08:
  Haswell:
  - tweak: Emitters can now be locked using IDs with engine room access while it's
      on or off.
  Techhead:
  - rscadd: Ghosts can flicker lights when the round is spooky enough.
2016-08-11:
  Haswell:
  - tweak: Engi-Vend and Robco Tool Maker machines can now be used by atmospheric
      technicians.
2016-08-15:
  Asanadas:
  - rscadd: Neural laces can now be destructed and created in a proper research lab.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: Invented supermatter grenades and made them available to certain sets
      of antags.
  - rscadd: The antag uplink now allows you to also buy x1 grenades, in addition to
      the x5 sets, with some markup.
  TheWelp:
  - rscadd: Adds ability for merchants to fast buy via cash using a banking system.
  - rscadd: Adds ability for players to sell things to merchants. They will only take
      things they like.
2016-08-18:
  Haswell:
  - tweak: The autopilot on the escape shuttle can no longer be overridden during
      crew transfers while on blue alert or lower. It can only be overridden during
      an evacuation, or during an alert level higher than blue.
  Karolis2011:
  - rscadd: Added whole map capture tool, only accessable by admins.
2016-08-22:
  Asanadas:
  - rscadd: The Exodus robotics lab has a newly installed Robotech deluxe (we found
      it out in the shed). Also, a new light switch.
2016-08-26:
  Asanadas:
  - rscadd: Dug out an old engineering vending machine and added it to the engineering
      workshop.
  Soadreqm:
  - rscadd: Made tape recorders use removable 10-minute cassettes instead of 60-minute
      internal storage.
  TheWelp:
  - rscadd: Adds four new traders, a robot trader, a pet trader, a replica trader,
      and a prank trader.
  - rscadd: Adds unique items (and a bot) for the traders to sell.
  - rscadd: Adds missing item worth values to the list.
  - tweak: Unique NPCs now stay around for twice as long.
  - tweak: Tweaks Hostile mob AI, so that if they have no faction at all, they will
      target nobody.
  - tweak: Spawner grenade can now set variables (using a list) upon spawning whatever
      it spawns.
2016-08-28:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: Telecrystal amount increased from 25 too 100 with uplink costs adjusted
      accordingly, all to allow even more price differentiation.
  - tweak: A five pack of grenades is now 20% cheaper than buying them one at a time.
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Power cell no longer use magical charge units. Instead they are rated in
      WattHours. For example, a cell with rating of 1000 will be capable of providing
      1000 watts for one hour. (or 2000 watts for half a hour, etc.)
  - tweak: In general this means that a power cell with rating of 1000 will hold MUCH
      more energy than it held before. To balance this out, power cell capacities
      have been reduced considerably. When these two changes add up the cells last
      for approximately same time as they used to.
  - tweak: As part of this change, higher grade power cells have became a bit more
      rare. Research can still fabricate them in bulk, but they are much rarer from
      random spawns, and no longer available from vending machines. Vending machines
      provide standard cells instead. EngiVend can be hacked to provide few high capacity
      ones.
  - tweak: Vending machines no longer shoot objects at people when malfunctioning.
      They merely shudder and dump the item on the ground. This should make the random
      event a little bit less annoying.
  - tweak: Space heater's default temperature setting is now 20C (changed from 50C),
      which is the default station temperature. It can still be changed via the UI
      when the panel is open.
2016-08-29:
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Added /vg/ direct-action ventcrawling. You will now crawl through the
      actual pipe network, a step at a time. Have fun.
2016-08-30:
  Haswell:
  - rscdel: Atmospheric technician is now unavailable for general play.
  - rscadd: Alt title 'Atmospheric Technician' is now added to engineers.
  - tweak: Engineers now have all the accesses atmospheric technicians previously
      held.
  - tweak: Tweaked job selection screen to properly indicate which jobs aren't available
      to play as.
  Kelenius:
  - tweak: Cultists don't need to research words anymore.
  - tweak: Astral journey's damage over time lowered to sane levels.
  - tweak: Changeling revive, when the timer is up, will now give you a verb that
      revives you, allowing you to choose when to get up, instead of doing it immediately.
  - tweak: Changelings will always get DNA, species, and languages together, be it
      via absorbtion, DNA sting, or hive channel.
  - tweak: Changeling transform and change species was merged.
  - tweak: Changelings no longer display gender in changeling chat.
2016-09-02:
  Techhead:
  - rscadd: Medical splints can now also be applied to hands and feet (in addition
      to arms and legs).
  - rscadd: For those that miss the old functionality, ghetto splints have been added.
      These can be crafted with a roll of tape and a metal rod and can only splint
      arms and legs.
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Converts few other things over to work with the recent CELLRATE change.
      This fixes various issues where battery life of some things (drills, etc.) was
      very short, while some other things had power cells with very large capacities.
  - tweak: Hardsuits and Mechas now use energy in joules rather than Wh (this fixes
      Ninja suit, among others). Various exosuit tools now have rebalanced power usage.
      Energy based exosuit weapons use energy on per-shot basis, ballistic weapons
      use single massive spike when fabricating a new magazine.
  - tweak: Minor power-related changes to exosuit modules. Energy cost of some offensive
      modules increased a bit.
  - tweak: Added short cooldown for teleporter module to prevent spamming.
  - tweak: Added power usage to various industrial/science modules (anomaly scanner,
      various drills, etc.).
  - tweak: Increased mounted RCD power usage by a lot (matter fabrication is very
      power demanding process).
  - tweak: Powersink module is limited to 120kW transfer rate, and is slower (30kW)
      when used on APCs with enabled interface lock. Furthermore, when draining from
      APC it first tries to take energy from the grid, before resorting to taking
      it from the cell.
  - bugfix: APCs drained by a ninja no longer get stuck on 0% charge, and instead
      recharge themselves as usual.
  - rscadd: Repair capability of upgraded cyborg rechargers now also works on IPCs
      and FBPs.
  - tweak: If the cyborg recharger is upgraded enough, it will be capable of rebooting
      (and eventually repairing) destroyed modules, for some extra power.
2016-09-03:
  Haswell:
  - rscadd: Added a fashion vending machine in the locker room for snowflake loadout
      items.
  - rscadd: Added more SMES coils and circuitboard to supply packs.
  - tweak: Adjusted price of SMES coil.
  Superbee29:
  - bugfix: Changeling transformation (of itself and others via sting) no longer causes
      organ rejection.
  - bugfix: IPCs can no longer be stung by changelings.
2016-09-07:
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Added a hawaii shirt to loadout accessories. Can be attached to clothing
      like suit jackets etc. Can also be found in mixed wardrobes.
  Cirra:
  - rscadd: Spiderlings now have a unique sprite specific to the type of giant spider
      they will become.
  Kelenius:
  - rscadd: Ninjas now have access to a PDA that has an empty uplink (for exploitable
      information).
2016-09-09:
  Daranz:
  - tweak: If you crack open an amputated limb and later reattach it, you will now
      have to cauterize it after reattachment.
  Haswell:
  - tweak: Reduced wallet capacity, added more items that can fit in wallets.
2016-09-10:
  Cirra:

  Kelenius:
  - rscadd: Xenoarcheology code has been partially redone.
  - tweak: Pick set will now sort the picks inside it.
  - tweak: Removed useless random numbers from GPS coordinates in various places.
      I'm sure we have not lost the arcane knowledge of rounding 500 years into the
      future.
  - tweak: Picks renamed to show their excavation depths.
  - tweak: Suspension generator's power use lowered.
  - tweak: Suspension generator's different field types removed. By the way, remember

  - tweak: Tape measuring is a bit faster.
  - tweak: Scanner now shows the lowest and the highest depth of the find (highest
      is depth + clearance) for easier calculations. Ideally, you need to hit exactly
      the lowest spot. Less ideally, hit anywhere between higest and lowest. Hit below
      lowest and you have a chance to break the find.
  - tweak: You can now use a brush to clear strange rocks. Welder uses less fuel for
      that than before.
  - tweak: Anomaly analyser's report made a bit easier to read.
  - tweak: Anomaly locater will now also locate normal finds.
  - bugfix: Gas masks will now correctly spawn as archeological finds.

      bag into core sampler.
  - bugfix: CO2 generator effect now has a type.

      than the welding overlay.
  - tweak: Vision impairment from wearing a welding mask now stacks with nearsightedness
      due to now being two separate effects.
  - tweak: Species and individual specific nearsightedness now stacks, i.e. a nearsighted
      Resomi won't be aided at all to the same degree by the standard prescription
      glasses as other species would be.
  - tweak: Glasses can now have varying degrees of prescription.
2016-09-11:

      and a computer (laptop and console only). The new program allows AI restoration,
      as well as simple law modifications. It can also be used to purge malfunctioning
      AI's laws correctly. This program can only work on intellicarded AIs, that are
      placed in the computer itself. The program can be run/used by anyone, but requires
      head of staff level access to download from NTNet.
  - rscdel: Removed old AI integrity restorer console
2016-09-16:
  atlantiscze:

      them instead of killing.
2016-09-25:
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Can now pick color of labcoat in loadout menu, replacing separate preset
      colored coats. My condolences to those who had preset ones.

      in items.
2016-09-26:
  atlantiscze:

      first. Off-station APCs (that do not contribute to CPU generation) are appended
      to the bottom of the list.
  - rscdel: Airlock brace keycards have been removed.
  - tweak: Airlock braces when held inhand can be accessed and configured as an airlock
      electronics circuit board. Instead of brace keycards they can now be unlocked
      by swiping an ID with configured access (or by using maintenance jack). Configuring
      the brace has no access requirement, but it can't be configured when installed
      on an airlock.
2016-09-30:
  Kasuobes:
  - rscdel: Removed IR emitters until they are fixed and don't kill servers.

  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Added floating camera thing for Journalists, in the library office nook.
      It acts like a portable security camera on Thunderdome network. Can also send

2016-11-03:
  Broseph Stylin:
  - tweak: Most loadout items with multiple variants can now be found under lists
      in their respective categories. This change WILL mess up your saved loadouts,
      so be sure to redo them.
  Siegdermaus:
  - imageadd: Adds a new icon for turret and blast area caution signs.
2016-11-04:

      so be sure to redo them.
  Datraen:
  - tweak: Skrell now have mild darksight.
  - tweak: Skrell now prefer slightly warmer temperatures.
2016-11-08:
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Blobs are now considerably more resistant to energetic weapons, be it handheld
      lasers, energy guns, or even emitters. An emitter is still useful to suppress
      the blob a bit, but one emitter shouldn't be capable of outright killing the
      blob.
  - rscadd: Blob has a relatively small chance to grow secondary cores. These cores
      are considerably weaker, have lower health, but still help spread the blob a
      bit more.
  - tweak: Emitter power usage increased (30kW to 100kW). While it is still possible
      to run one with PACMAN, you have to keep it on overload.
  - tweak: Reinforced walls are now considerably more resistant against projectiles
      of all kinds, be it emitters, handheld weaponry, or anything else. Regular walls
      are unaffected. An emitter is still useful if you need to burn through one,
      but expect to wait - it needs over fifty pulses for a plasteel reinforced wall.
  - tweak: Details on the above. Reinforcement is calculated from the material that
      is used to reinforce the girders when building the wall. Weak materials such
      as wood have 0% reduction in taken damage. Most basic materials have 50% or
      so. Steel is decent material with 80% reduction. Plasteel is very good with
      90%, and titanium is the best with approx. 92% reduction (though it has lower
      overall health)
  - rscdel: Removed bubble shield generators, hull shield generators and shield capacitors.
      Also removed shield disrupter.
  - rscadd: Added a replacement advanced shield generator, that has a combined function
      of a capacitor, and both shield generators (hull shielding is toggleable). This
      shield generator must be built and once constructed is immobile (but can be
      deconstructed again). These generators are fully configurable, have better hull
      shielding that doesn't block shuttles, mass drivers and others, and have different
      energy system. Damage will drain the shield's energy directly.
  - rscadd: Added Shield Diffusers. Two variants exist - floor mounted and handheld.
      The handheld variant can be purchased from traitor uplink, and runs on an internal
      cell. The floor mounted variant layers under floor tiles and is APC powered.
      These diffusers dissipate shields in adjacent tiles (+ shaped pattern). The
      generator can be set to try to counter these, in which case each diffuser causes
      major EM strain on the shield.
  - maptweak: Added two shield generator circuit boards and two shield diffuser circuit
      boards into tech storage.
2016-11-09:
  Irrationalist:
  - bugfix: Unathi and Tajara can now spawn and show preview with gloves included

  - rscdel: Got rid of the awful singletank code.
  - rscadd: 'Created new singletank construction and disassembly code (see below):
      Single Tank devices must be wired before having assemblies attached.'
  - tweak: Single tank devices are single use only with their igniters. The igniters
      create a small bit of heat to get fuel to its burn temperature (126C).
  - tweak: Added relief valve to air tanks. They now trigger leak logic at over 173C
      or leak pressure. Can be welded shut to prevent leakage.
  - tweak: Single Tank devices must be wired before having assemblies attached.
  - tweak: Air from rupturing/exploding tanks now merged into environment instead
      of deleted.
  - tweak: Explosion radii based on pressure, gas amount, and volume of rupturing
      vessel.
  - bugfix: Assemblies can now be used when attached.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: 'New Ion law: Lawbound Synths may now have to communicate with the crew
      in a random language other than Galactic Common.'
  Zuhayr:
  - tweak: The gibber is now called a meat grinder, since that's what it is.
  - tweak: Eating a human organ or limb is now done in the exact same manner as any
      other food. If you try to eat a limb, though, it will not be usable in a transplant,
      for obvious reasons.
  - tweak: Human organs now fit into the reagent grinder.

      clone damage.'
  - tweak: Slime nutrition drain reduced.
  - tweak: Added a small delay between the slime latch and the first damage dealt.
  - tweak: Changed how slimes react to damage. Slimes that are attacked with something
      will sometimes be shaken off their victims (chance is force * 5 - anything with
      force or 20 or above is a guaranteed shake-off).
  - tweak: Disarming a slime or wrestling them off now has a chance to disorient them
      for a moment. Throwing them off with a weapon doesn't do that.
  - tweak: Water will make slimes lose their target, stop feeding, and will disorient
      them for a moment on the first application (they will not be stunlocked and
      repeated applications have no effect).
  - tweak: Slimes now twice as weak to water - PLEASE remember that spraying them
      more than once is a waste, the water is already on them and killing them.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where slime's nutrition was always maxed out when they fed,
      causing them to evolve and split instantly.

      surgery success chance calculation.
  - rscadd: 'Said success chance: surgery steps now can fail even if you don''t move
      / drop tools etc. Ideal scenario is ''sober surgeon not in pain operating on
      another person who is lying on an optable''. Deviations from that add chance
      of failure. Some steps are more robust, some are more delicate. As a rule of
      a thumb, if you have to touch innards, that''s delicate. If you perform internal
      organ surgery on yourself while sitting on a table piss drunk, nearly passing

  - rscadd: Among other information, the supermatter monitor program shows engine
      core EPR value. This value is best kept between 1 and 2, and shows real amount
      of coolant in the core (in standard canisters worth). Normal EPR with two canisters
      in each loop is roughly 1.5
  - rscdel: Rightclick open/close laptop verb no longer exists for laptops. Use alt-click

  - tweak: Defib units now start with an APC power cell (Down from advanced) for R&D
      to replace as the round goes on. The APC cell will be able to shock the patient

2017-05-20:
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: All toys guns are now fitted with red bits on the barrel so you can visually
      tell them apart! Very safe! Fun for whole family!
  - rscadd: Can use wirecutters on toy revolvers to snip those off. It also changes
      examine name to 'revolver' instead of 'toy gun'. In case you didn't know, those
      are proper guns and you can hold people hostage with those. Just saying. Do
      not try at home.
  Cirra:
  - tweak: Attempting to place an airlock brace without setting an access requirement
      now informs you, and asks for confirmation.
  Orelbon:
  - rscadd: Added inhand sprite for stun rifle.
  Ornias1993:
  - bugfix: Everyone including military can now take sunglasses from loadout.
2017-05-23:
  Asanadas:
  - tweak: Maintenance Drones now require an account of age 3 days or greater.
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Bunch of virus changes. Buckle up, kiddo. Praise Nurgle
  - rscadd: Adds Space Cold event. Spawns a harmless virus that can be treated with
      cold medicine. Unless you're irradiated and it mutates to kill everyone I guess.
  - rscadd: Adds space cold medicine (dextra-something) to white first aid boxes.
      Can also be made by mixing paracetamol+sugar. Eating it will stop weak viruses
      symptoms from manifesting.
  - rscadd: Humans now have crude immune system simulation. Keeping your immunity
      high makes it easier to shrug off viruses, extremely low (15% and less) immunity
      can get you random space cold-level infections. Get lemons for boosting it,
      spaceacilin ruins it. It recovers to norm over time.
  - tweak: Spaceacillin now ODs at 15u instead of 30u.
  - tweak: Spaceacillin now metabolizes faster. It was 60+ minutes for 15u, 30 minutes
      now.
  - tweak: Spaceacillin boosts immune system effective rating. It acts as a multiplier
      to natural one, from 1x at none in blood to 2x at OD threshold (15u), and you
      can go higher if you don't mind ODing. Also if natural immunity is lower than
      the boost, boost would just replace it.
  - tweak: Spaceacillin has three stages now. Below 10 units it acts kinda like now,
      blocking badness 2 virus effects. Virus would still progress though, but effects
      won't fire. It's enough for any random event virus effects.
  - tweak: Above 10 units it would completely stop progression of badness 2 viruses
      and stop effects of badness 3 - which is usual stuff ou get from viro labs.
      Again, clock will still be ticking. Also at this stage it starts lowering your
      natural immunity value.
  - tweak: And then, there's OD. OD stops badness 4 (e.g. Gibbingtons) from manifesting,
      and stops ticking of lower viruses. It screws your immune system even stronger
      too.
  - tweak: It's also not 100% protecting you from infection now. 15u and above give
      old 100% protection, scaling with lower value in blood.
  - tweak: Some tweaks to virus annoyningness. Hard delay between firings (25-40 seconds
      between message-only syndromes), emote syndromes (groaning, moaning, screaming)
      are now single syndrome to make it rarer. Internals actually stopping you from
      spreading viruses. No airborne viruses in vacuum.
  - tweak: As an unrealated bonus, first aid (white and fire) boxes now have paracetamol
      bottles because damn it's easier to score opiates than that.
  - tweak: Oh also remember how when you graft yourself Tajaran arms it kills you?
      Not when your immunity is floored. Just saying.
  Orelbon:
  - maptweak: Tech storage has been moved to deck two, where the abandoned officers
      mess was located. The officers mess has been moved into the previous location
      of tech storage.

      claimed by clicking them in-hand
  - tweak: Rings are now compatible with the material system, and can be made via
      sheets.
  - bugfix: You can no longer clip rings like gloves, and all species except Diona
      can wear them now.
2017-06-17:
  Asanadas:
  - bugfix: No longer will you be able to freely pass onto upright tables by moving
      onto them from a tile which has a flipped table.
  Chaoko99:
  - rscadd: Added a mass-defile cultist rune. Buyer beware; it may kill you.
  - rscadd: Cult tiles play a snazzy animation on creation.
  - rscadd: The soulstone shard now notifies the player when it is full, asks if you
      wish to release the spirit within.
  - rscdel: Removed Manifests from the cultist repertoire.
  - rscdel: Removed defile giving cultist levels.
  - tweak: Changed the values for cultiness (The value which controls spell levels).
      You will need to either recruit 10 cultists, or perform 10 sacrifices to unlock
      Nar-Sie.
  - tweak: Nerfed cultist robes. Buffed cultist voidsuits. The latter of which is
      still impossible to obtain.
  - bugfix: Made the restricted/protected/blacklisted roles for cultists torch-compatible.
  - bugfix: Fixed construct and familiar spells.
  - rscdel: Removed Vox Pariah.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Can now rig assemblies/devices(e.g. radio signalers) to trigger when crate
      is opened. Click wires on open crate, then click with assemblies. It would trigger
      when opened next time. Use wirecutter to unrig.
  - tweak: AI cores got new step in construction. You need to swipe an ID with Upload
      access (or emag) to hook them into the systems.
  - rscadd: Added rubber masks and suits to party crate. Dress up as war hero or SCG
      secretary or a naked tajara like you always wanted.
  - tweak: Made SHOCK mode on tasers literally useless, ruining security gameplay.
      Does bit less burn damage, and much less straight up stun damage. Not 'better
      tase mode' anymore.
  - bugfix: Fixed their primary function actually never working. If you hit arm or
      hand with the beam you can disarm someone (even diona, even robbit, pain reception
      doesn't matter). If you hit leg, they might drop, higher chance for foot.
  Hubblenaut:
  - bugfix: Manifold pipes show up properly on t-ray scanners now.
  - bugfix: Space lube now properly disappears.
  - tweak: Can now put items in vendors by using click and drop, thus allowing screwdrivers,
      multitools and similar.

  sabiram:
  - rscadd: Research module robots now have access to a welding tool.
2017-06-19:
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Speed now matters when flying into meteor field. Still - 25% the meteors,
      below 0.3 - 60% of usual, normal otherwise until above 3 speed, where you start
      getting double the fun. Also if ship is moving most meteors will fly in from
      front and sides.
  - tweak: Changes spess dust event. It used to be a single wave of quasi-meteors
      that exploded for a bit before dying. There were no further waves until you
      left and came back. Now waves keep coming ~twice a minute. Dust itself is now
      a pile of micrometeors - basically space bullets. It wouldn't do a lot of damage
      to the hull, but can break windows and makes EVA pretty damn dangerous.
  - tweak: SCG had mastered the secret art of 'background check'. CO and XO are no
      longer be eligible for roundstart antag roles on Torch. Can still be converted
      in round
  - bugfix: As a side effect, they aren't going to get rev'd anymore, that was a bug.
  ZeroBits:
  - rscadd: Added the ability to have multiple loadouts per character.
  - rscadd: Added magic invisibility ring and reagent rings.

  - rscadd: Added coffee cups to the loadout selection.
  - rscadd: Added threebread, blueberries, pancakes, and two new flavors of ice-cream.
2017-06-30:
  Chaoko99:
  - tweak: Poppies now contain tramadol.
  - bugfix: Fixed the phrasing in the set-pose verb.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: NT has sent some more testing supplies. Nothing to see really. RDs can
      find details in a super secret folder in their office. Others - do no peek,
      ok.
  - tweak: Surgery now produces normal wounds instead of snowflake 'open incisions'.
      Do not be alarmed, do not bandage those if you plan to continue surgery, clamp.
      If incision was made with scalpel, you'll be able to cauterize it, healing a
      lot of damage.
  - tweak: Skull/ribs surgery changed, now you just need to use the saw to crack em.
      Fractures count as being open too. Retractor steps for ribs etc are gone, use
      normal bone repair surgery aferwards.
  - tweak: Coincidently you can just rip them apart with cut wounds to get access
      to innard surgery steps. It takes much more damage than surgical incisions though.
  - tweak: Bones now fracture when damage is taken rather than from existing damage.
      Meaning if you fix bones, they won't refracture immediately without taking damage.
  - tweak: You don't need to crack open the bones to get shrapnel now. If you can
      see it on examine, you can take it out with just a retracted incision.
  - rscadd: Added new surgery step - disinfecting wounds. You can use sterilizine
      or high proof booze, in spraybottles/droppers/bottles/glasses/buckets. Works
      same as ointment.
  ParadoxSpace:
  - rscadd: Adds darksight to space adapted humans
  Ravensdale:
  - tweak: Cultists now speak in the cult tongue when activating runes instead of
      their default language. Done in case a changeling cultist ever becomes a thing.
  - rscdel: Removed special human kabobs and burgers. Lumping all items that are 'red
      meat' together.
  - tweak: Adjusted AI tracking verbs. AI will now have a more difficult time tracking
      specific people depending on method and if person has their face concealed.
  - tweak: To bring some consistency for the above, also adjusted how names appear
      on mobs that have some sort of face covering or a face that is... not there.
  Zucchinsky:
  - rscadd: Beeg medical changes. Like holy crap. Get a crash course on https://wiki.baystation12.net/index.php?title=Zuhmed_Guide
  - rscadd: Death now occurs when brain dies. Brain's health replaces overall 'health'
  - rscadd: Death is now FINAL, baring relacing. Don't let that brain die.
  - rscadd: Crit now exists as flatlining, the heart failure, or as fancily 'asystole'.
      It happens when heart is damaged, not enough blood or oxygen in blood, or high
      levels of shock.
  - rscadd: In crit you do the usual gasping thing and take brain damage. USE CRP
      or defib to revive em. If they die before you crack ribs, you hadn't tried hard
      enough.
  - rscadd: '''Toxins'' damage is now overall organ failure, basically sum of organ
      damage. Poisons will try to destroy liver and kidney first, and will damage
      the rest after those two are down. Some poisons go straight for vitals. Liver
      will heal self until it''s too damaged.'
  - rscadd: '''Suffocation'' damage is now used as modifier to your blood levels.
      If you don''t get enough air, you get effects of low blood basically.'
  - rscadd: Defibs now restart failed hearts instead of reviving dead. Also named
      differently now.
  - rscadd: Most scanner readouts are changed now. Instead of damage values they report
      vitals (pulse/blood pressure/brain activity) and general state of damage.
  - rscadd: A D R E N A L I N E. When you take a good chunk of damage at once (15
      or more in one hit) you generate bit of adrenaline reagent according to damage
      taken. It acts like strong painkiller / pulse raiser for a tick or two, becoming
      weaker after that.
  - rscadd: FBPs and IPCs now have batteries in their chests. They have HYPERCELLS
      and drain when they stand (unbuckled) or move around (double drain then).
  - rscadd: Sleepers now have stomach pumps, same as filtering but for ingested stuff.
  - rscadd: Cultists yo - sacrifice rune now works on someone in asystole rather than
      full braindeath. Knives now count for all steps needed to cut out the heart,
      and cult runes count as surgery spots. Just sayin'.
  - rscadd: Bunch of chems is different now. First off, none 'reduce' toxins damage,
      aside from peridaxon cause tht's organ damage now.
  - rscadd: Peridaxon only treats brain damage if it's not too severe. Get Alkysine
      otherwise.
  - rscadd: Alkysine will only work if brain is fully oxygenated, so refill blood
      and air first.
  - rscadd: Dylovene removes toxic reagents from blood.
  - rscadd: Dexlaine fools brain into thinking you got at least 50% of air you needed.
      For Dex+ it's 80%.
  - rscadd: Cryox/Clonex also have Dex/Dex+ effect respectively.
  - rscadd: Inapro prevents suffocating while in asystole, slows pulse down (which
      slows bleeding a bit) and has mild painkiller effect as it did.
2017-07-06:
  Chaoko99:
  - tweak: Added a full belt to engineering lockers.
  - tweak: Removes all (direct) references to Metroids from our codebase. Not being
      sued is nice.
  - imageadd: Replaced our RPED sprite with /TG/'s, and added a little animation atop
      that.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Can now scoop corgis up, like cats or nymphs etc.
  - rscdel: Can also use them instead of sausages in microwave to make hotdogs. Geddit,
      hehehe hot dogs. Riot.
  - tweak: GUPpy, Calypso and Aquila now can share destinations, as long as they can
      fit.
  - rscadd: Excavation prep closets now have BLUESPACE FLARES. You can activate those
      in a nice open spot to create a new navpoints for shuttles (ones mentioned)
      to go to.
  - rscadd: Exploration shuttles (Calypso/Guppy/Aquila) now can share destinations
      (with some other shuttles too).

  - bugfix: Ghosts can hear binary chatter again.
2017-07-09:
  Chaoko99:
  - tweak: Made it so a butterfly knife spawns in your hand instead of on the floor
      when completed.
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Bluespace jump effects have changed. Engineers found that some duct tape
      got unstuck because of a WD40 leak, so they fixed it. Now you can't zoom through
      the walls, and visibility is a bit better. You also don't get confused forever,
      just for a minute or so. There are some... unforseen side effects, but they
      seem harmless. A word from Chief Tech (before his disappearace) - KEEP IT REAL.
  Hubblenaut:
  - rscadd: Gives holowarrants their own handheld item.
  - tweak: Holowarrants will now broadcast updates on warrants instead of security
      HUDs.
  - tweak: Authorizing a warrant using the holowarrant will now broadcast a message.
  ParadoxSpace:
  - rscadd: Unathi across the universe have been informed of new lore changes, and

  Heptagon49:
  - bugfix: Changes the recipes for Methylphenidate and Antidexafen so they no longer
      overlap. Methyl now requires lithium instead of hydrazine, and antidexafen now
      requires carbon instead of sugar.
  - tweak: Lowered the max damage of internal organs, except for the brain and cortical
      stack.
  - tweak: Prosthetic internal organs are now stronger then regular organs.
  - tweak: Kidneys are actually important now. You will slowly take toxin damage if
      they are missing or busted, same as the liver.
  - imageadd: Changed the sprites for the prosthetic liver and kidneys.
  - rscadd: Prosthetic lungs half the toxin damage taken from breathing bad air.
  - tweak: Made assisted organs slightly worse.
  Hubblenaut:
  - tweak: Air shutters will not be automatically opened by a clearing air alarm when
      it would be dangerous to do.
  ParadoxSpace:
  - rscadd: Unathi across the galaxy have realised the implications of having tails,
      and now use them to attack instead of their legs.
  atlantiscze:
  - rscadd: Can now order OCP and plasteel from cargo. Furthermore, 10 and 50 sheet
      crates are available for some more expensive sheet types, with 50 sheet crates
      being more cost efficient.
  mkalash:
  - tweak: Replaced tgui ticket panel with an autoupdating basic Topic() one
  - rscadd: Added time stamps to messages on the ticket panel, and a measure of how
      long an unanswered ticket has been open
  - rscadd: Added a PM button to the ticket panel
  - tweak: Adminhelping with an open ticket will either send another adminhelp to
      the same ticket, or PM one of the assigned admins if there are any
  - bugfix: No more sanitation weirdness in ticket panels
  - tweak: A ticket is no longer created anyway if an admin cancels sending a PM to
      someone who didn't have a ticket
  - bugfix: Fixed admins being able to create tickets for logged out players
  - bugfix: Fixed mods and trialmins being unable to use the ticket panel
2017-07-24:
  Hubblenaut:
  - tweak: If a cycling airlock is already near the target pressure, pressing the
      buttons will toggle the doors instead of making it reenter the cycle process.
  - bugfix: Fixes blood splatters reappearing when lifting or putting floor tiles
      down.
  PsiOmegaDelta:

      and occupations as according to lore.

      on the device''s CPU) hacks the network and when finished adds a random access
      to the ID. ID must be kept inside the device while running. Can be repeatedly
      used to get multiple accesses. Has chance of yielding access that''s already
      present on the ID, and therefore will do nothing wasting some time.'
  Broseph Stylin:
  - rscadd: Added weight lifting machines and punching bags. They provide no mechanical
      benefits, and will deplete your nutrition as they're used. The weight machine

      ID.
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Slimetoxin. Slimetoxin changed. Instead of pop and go slimeficiation it's
      now a life threatening process. Slime toxin metabolizes slowly, and deals fair
      bit of toxins damage. For every unit or so metabolized, it mutates one limb.
      Once every limb mutated, there's a 10% every tick to fully mutate into a slimegirl.
      If you're lucky, you might mutate right before death and that'd heal your all
      wounds! That' a great idea!
  Devildabeast:
  - rscadd: Adds a cyborg recharging station to the Auxiliary Head.

  - rscadd: Desert exoplanets, rich with minerals below the surface, which is covered
      with dangerous quicksand
  - rscadd: Mountainous exoplanets, one of the three other options, but also covered
      with surface minerals

      works on APC, SMES, Turret, Turret control, Camera. It is easily expandable
      to any machinery in the future.
  - rscadd: Adds four new abilities in a new passive tree. T1 prevents intellicard
      transfers (toggleable), T2 removes BSOD/lockout from APCs, but reduces CPU generation

      for engineering to experiment with.
  - tweak: Edits the RUST manual to fit the new setup.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - experiment: Overhauls how reagents are identified, affecting both chemistry and
      food. Due to the large scale of these changes more or less subtle bugs may have
      crept their way in.
  ThatOneGuy:
  - rscadd: Can now play as the Explorer Department if you are a EC member. If a complete
      failure, up for removal.

  Zuhayr:
  - tweak: R-UST backend/manual changes.
2017-09-13:
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Changed way lung damage affects people. Instead of straight up oxyloss,
      it now makes you require higher oxygen pressure - so you can work around it
      with high pressure internals. Of course it's not 100% failsafe, as blood coughing
      and breathing stops still remain.
  - rscadd: Inapro does more things now. It can heal brain damage up to 60, and also
      slows down brain damaging a general, more effective at higher oxygenation.
  - rscadd: Health analyzers report brain damage a bit different now. They don't report
      damage that will self-heal without meds. New stage 'minor brain damage' covers
      range that can be healed with inapro. Rest are more or less same.
  - rscadd: Painstuff tweaked around, should generally see slightly less instant KOs
      from lethal damages.

  - maptweak: An Exploration Equipment area which can only be accessed by the Exploration
      department has been mapped on Deck 4 Aft.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Pulse now affects blood circulation. Lower pulse effectively lowers it
      and vice versa.
  - rscadd: Extremely high pulse risks damaging the heart. Shouldn't be a lot, but
      it's there.
  - rscadd: As you lose blood oxygenation, your pulse tries to rise to compensate.
      Thready (>250) pulse will cause a cardiac arrest.
  - rscadd: Inaprovaline tries to bring pulse to normal levels, either up or down.
      It also prevents thready pulse.
  - rscadd: Heart stopping is slightly less 100% surefire, so if you manage to get
      heart restarted it might beat for few ticks first.
  - rscadd: You no longer need lungs/mouth to give CPR, but you will only do the heart
      bit. Checks still apply for mouth-to-mouth.
  - rscadd: Shock stage stars rising earlier now (30 damage vs 50) and can go bit
      higher than usual.
  - rscadd: Painkillers speed changed. Now they ramp up slower if ingested, but stay
      longer. Opposite if injected.
  - rscadd: Tramadol and oxcodone injectors added to medical vendomats (and tramadol
      ones to hacked firstaid vendomats).
  - rscadd: Adds some goodies to survival boxes - inapro injector, food and light.
  - rscadd: Changed how tramadol/oxycodone work a bit. They now have period for setting
      in and wearing off, gradually ramping power up/down. Those are short, ~20 seconds
      to reach max
  - rscadd: Mixing those with alcohol is now as bad idea as it's supposed to be -
      increased liver damage and respiratory depression (harder time beathing) await
      you
  - rscadd: Inaprovaline helps against breathing effects of both mixing and ODing.
  - rscadd: There's now some effects based on how much you consume over time, rather
      than single dose. Effects stat at 15u with some slowdown and chance to start
      slurring, ramp up from there, with major slowdown and slurring after OD-worthy
      doses is metabolized.
  - rscadd: Also ODing on those will give you even MORE painkilling effect! At a small
      cost of suffocating most likely, and don't even try doing that AND booze.
  - rscadd: Ships now have sensors. Overmap is dark by default, with known sectors
      emitting some light. Dust/rocks/ion block visibility. You can control the sensor
      with console(s) on the bridge, its power setting sets how far it will shine.
      Higher settings use /huge/ mounts of power so don't leave it running on those.
      Sensors also cannot run in non-vacuum.

      comparsions.

      just reminders.
  - rscadd: Now the fun part is their abuse - when victim has mindbreaker in blood
      and implanted with those, implant wires deep enough to fool host that he actually

      If you don't have air at all, you might use remaining air in lungs for one message.

      creature', and you can use a Name Alien Species verb to rename them when you
