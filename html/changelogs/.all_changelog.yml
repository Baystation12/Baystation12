      to their back.
  - tweak: The Bartender's spare beanbag shells have been moved into bar backroom
      with the shotgun.
  - bugfix: Portable air pumps now fill based on external/airtank pressure when pumping
      in.
2015-05-16:
  GinjaNinja32:
  - rscadd: Rewrote tables. To construct a table, use steel to make a table frame,
      then plate the frame with a material such as steel, gold, wood, etc. Hold a
      stack in your hand and drag it to the table to reinforce it. To deconstruct
      a table, use a screwdriver to remove the reinforcements (if present), then a
      wrench to remove the plating, and a wrench again to dismantle the frame. Use
      a welder to repair any damage. Use a carpet tile on a table to add felt, and
      a crowbar to remove it.
  HarpyEagle:
  - rscadd: Adds tail animations for tajaran and unathi. Animations are controlled
      using emotes.

  - tweak: Goats will move towards vines that are 4 spaces away now instead of 1
  - bugfix: Goats will eat the spawning plants for vines as well as the vines themselves.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Ghetto diagnosis. Grab patient, aim at bodypart you want to check, click
      on them with help intent. This will tell you about their wounds, fractures and
      other oddities (toxins/oxygen) for that bodypart.
  - rscadd: Fractures are visible on very damaged limbs. Dislocations are always visible.
      Surgery incisions now visible too.

  Yoshax:
  - tweak: Bear traps now do damage when stood on, enough to break bones! Bear traps
      can now affect any limb of a person who is on the ground, including head! Bear
      traps are no longer legcuffs and instead embed in the limb they attack.
  - tweak: Bear traps now take several seconds to deploy and cannot be picked up when
      armed, they must be disarmed by clicking on them. They also cannot be moved
      then they are deployed.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Massive material refactor. Walls, beds, chairs, stools, tables, ashtrays,
      knives, baseball bats, axes, simple doors, barricades, so on.
  - rscadd: Tables are now built via steel then another sheet on the resulting frame.
      They can then be reinforced by dragging a stack of sheets onto the table.
  - rscadd: Walls are built with steel for girders, then right-click the girder and
      select the reinforce verb while holding a stack, then click the girders with
      a final sheet.
  - rscadd: Various things can be built with various sheet types. Experiment! Just
      keep in mind that uranium is now radioactive and phoron is now flammable.
2015-05-26:
  Atlantis:
  - rscadd: NanoUI for Robotics Control Console
  - rscadd: NanoUI for Supermatter Crystal - AI/Robot only, purely informational
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Meat limbs now can be attached. Use limb on missing area, then hemostat
      to finalize it.
  - rscadd: Limbs from other races can be now attached. They'll cause rejection, but
      it can be kept at bay with spaceacilline to some point. Species special attack
      is carried over too, i.e. you can clawn people if you sew a cathand to yourself.
  - rscadd: Limbs that are left in open will rot in ~7 minutes. Use freezers or cryobags
      to stop it. You can still attach them, but you wish you couldn't.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: Both the pulse taker and target must now remain still for the duration
      of the check or it will fail.
  RavingManiac:
  - rscadd: Tape recorders now record hearable emotes and action messages (e.g. gunshots).
  - bugfix: You can now see actions from inside mechs and closets.
  Techhead:
  - rscadd: Removed gaseous reagents from the chemistry system and replaced with real-world
      organic chemistry precursors.
  - rscadd: Hydrogen has been replaced with hydrazine, a highly toxic, flammable liquid.
  - rscadd: Oxygen has been replaced with acetone, a mildly toxic liquid. Ethanol's
      ink-sovlent capabilities have been copied to it.
  - rscadd: Chlorine has been replaced with hydrochloric acid. It is a stronger acid
      than sulphuric but less toxic.
  - tweak: Nitrogen has been replaced with ammonia. Ammonia now acts as a Dexalin-equivalent
      for Vox.
  - tweak: Flourine has also been replaced with hydrazine in its one recipe. Flourosurficant
      has been renamed azosurficant.
  - tweak: Being splashed with liquid Phoron will burn eyes and contaminate clothes
      like being exposed to Phoron gas.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Added a ghost requisition system for posibrains and living plants.
  - rscadd: Added attack_ghost() to hydro trays and posibrains to allow ghosts to
      enter them.
  - rscadd: Prosthetic limbs are now only repairable with welders/cable coils if they
      have suffered below 30 combined damage.
  - rscadd: 'Surgery steps that cause no pain and have no failure wounding have been
      added: screwdriver for ''incision'', crowbar to open, multitool to ''decouple''
      a prosthetic organ. Hemostat is still used to take an organ out.'
  - rscadd: Using a welder or a cable coil as a surgical tool after opening a maintenance
      hatch will repair damage beyond the 30 damage cap. In other words, severe damage
      to robolimbs requires expert repair from someone else.
  - rscdel: Eye and brain surgery were removed; they predate the current organ system
      and are redundant.
  - rscadd: IPC are now simply full prosthetic bodies using a specific manufacturer
      (Morpheus Cyberkinetics).
  - rscadd: IPC can 'recharge' in a cyborg station to regain nutriment. They no longer
      interface with APCs.
  - rscadd: NO_BLOOD flag now bypasses ingested and blood reagent processing.
  - rscadd: NO_SCAN now bypasses mutagen reagent effects.

  - tweak: Scoop-up behavior is now standardized to selecting help intent and dragging
      their icon onto yours.
2015-05-30:
  Atlantis:
  - rscadd: Malfunction Overhaul - Whole gamemode was completely reworked from scratch.
      Most old abilities have been removed and quite a lot of new abilities was added.
      AI also has to hack APCs to unlock higher tier abilities faster, instead of
      having access to them from the round start. Most forced things, such as, shuttle
      recalling were removed and are instead controlled by the AI. Code is fully modular
      allowing for future modifications.
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixes Engineer ERT gloves not being insulated.
  - tweak: IV stands are no longer bullet shields. They also allow mice, drones, pAIs
      et al to pass though.
  Kelenius:
  - tweak: AI now hears LOOC both around its eye and its core, and speaks in LOOC
      around its eye. Keep in mind that you won't hear and won't be heard if there
      is a wall between your eye and the target.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: You can now review the server revision date and hash by using the 'Show
      Server Revision' verb in the OOC category.

      as something else while their body lives.
  Techhead:

  - rscadd: Prison break event will warn Enginering and the AI beforehand so they
      can take preventive measures.
  - bugfix: Disabling area power will now prevent doors from opening during the event
2015-06-05:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - bugfix: Split stacks no longer lose their coloring.
  - tweak: Can no longer merge cables of different colors.
  - tweak: Blobs and simple mobs now attack all external organs instead of a subset.
      The overall damage remains the same but the number of fractures caused will,
      in general, be fewer.
  - rscadd: Spider nurses now have a chance of injecting their victims with spider
      eggs which eventually hatch. If the limb is removed from the host, the host
      dies, or the spiderling has matured sufficiently it will crawl out into freedom.
      Medical scanners will pick upp eggs and spiderlings as foreign bodies.
  Yoshax:
  - tweak: Makes hyposprays start empty instead of filled with Tricord.
  - tweak: Makes the special wizard projectile staffs, Animate, Change, Focus and
      any future ones only usable by wizards. Also makes it so only wizards can use
      spellbooks and teleportation scrolls.

  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: The AI chassis now glows, with the color depending on the currently selected
      display.

      in a greater variety, and may drop ores on their final destruction.
2015-06-16:
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: 'Updated penlights to be more of use in diagnostics, they now show following
      conditions:'
  - rscadd: Eye damage
  - rscadd: Blurry eyes (overall slower reaction)
  - rscadd: Brain damage (one eye reacts slower)
  - rscadd: Opiates use (pinpoint pupils)
  - rscadd: Drugs use (dilated pupils)
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: Observers can now follow both the AI and its eye upon speech.
  - rscadd: Observers can now follow both observers and their body, if they ever had
      one, upon speech.

  - rscadd: Matches can now be used to light things adjacent to you when thrown.
  - tweak: Made the effects of having a damaged robotic leg more prominent.
  - bugfix: Robot limbs no longer cause pain messages. A reminder that you can still
      check their status with 'Help Intent' -> 'Click Self'.
  - tweak: Knifing damage scales with weapon force and throat protection. Helmets
      only provide throat protection if they are air tight. Trying to cut someone's
      throat with wirecutters and/or while wearing an armoured sealed helmet will
      require several attempts before the victim passes out.
  - tweak: Knifing switches on harm intent, in case you just wanted to beat on the
      victim for some reason.
  - bugfix: Prevents knifing bots or silicons.
2015-06-22:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: The traitor uplink no longer displays all items in a long list, instead
      has categories which when accessed shows the relevant items.
2015-06-24:
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixed Tajaran name generation producing names without a space between
      first and last.
  - wip: Adds docking to the mercenary shuttle. Works similarly to other shuttles,
      except docking and undocking is manually initiated and not automatic. A system
      to approve or deny dock requests still to be implemented.
  - rscadd: Toolboxes can now hold larger items, such as stacks of metal or power
      cells, at the cost of having less space for other things.
  - tweak: Gloves/shoes can now be worn even if you have one hand/foot missing. The
      other one still has to be present, of course. The items still drop when you
      first lose the hand/foot.
  - tweak: Budget insulated gloves are somewhat less useless. On average, they will
      stop half the damage from getting shocked, and the worst case insulation is
      not as bad as it used to be. Budget gloves that are as good as regular insulated
      gloves are still as rare as they were before though.
  - tweak: PTR bullets are now hitscan, to make them somewhat better for actual sniping.
  - maptweak: The telecoms server room now has an actual cycling airlock into it.
  - tweak: Non-vital body parts will no longer take further damage above a certain

  - bugfix: Damaged robotic legs now more likely to have an effect.
  - bugfix: Fixed bug preventing internal organs from taking damage in some cases.
  - maptweak: New flavours of tables around the station. Engineering starts with more
      plastic.
  - bugfix: Fixed worn items not appearing in some cases. Most notably crossbows and
      certain guns when worn on the back. As a side effect, laundry machines no longer
      transform items.
  - bugfix: Crit oxyloss now runs in game time instead of real time. So if lag is
      slowing your movement the same slowdown applies to the dying person you're trying
      to reach.
  - rscadd: Breathmasks can now be adjusted by clicking on them in your hand, in addition
      to the verb.
  - rscadd: Wearing a space helmet or similar face-covering gear now prevents eating
      and force-feeding food, drink, and pills.
  - rscadd: Phoron in air ignites above it's flashpoint temperature and a certain
      (very small) minimum concentration. Environments that have oxygen and are hot
      enough, and have phoron but not enough concentration to burn will produce flareouts,
      which are mostly a visual effect.
  - rscadd: Adds animation when making unarmed attacks or attacking with melee weapons,
      to help make it clearer who is attacking.
  - soundadd: Opening an unpowered door now has an appropriate sound.
  - rscadd: Ingesting diseased blood may contract the disease.

      them.
2015-07-31:
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixed projectiles being able to hit people in body parts that they don't
      have. This will also mean that the less limbs someone has the less effective
      they will be as a body shield.
2015-08-11:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - experiment: 0.1.19 is live.
  - tweak: Crew monitors now update every 5th second instead of every other. Reduces
      lag and gives antags a larger window of opportunity to disable suit sensors
      if they have to harm someone.
2015-08-13:
  GinjaNinja32:
  - rscadd: Changed language selection to allow multiple language selections, changed
      humans/unathi/tajarans/skrell to not automatically gain their racial language,
      instead adding it to the selectable languages for that species. Old slots will
      warn when loaded that the languages may not be what you expect.
  Orelbon:
  - rscadd: Changed the HoP's suit to more bibrant colors and hopefully you will like
      it.

  HarpyEagle:
  - spellcheck: Renames many guns to follow a consistent naming style. Updated and

      crate at cargo).
  - rscdel: Sleeper consoles removed. All interaction is now done by clicking on the

      ballistic rifles (not SMGs) have moderate amounts, laser cannon has high armour
      penetration, and the PTR mostly ignores body armour.
  - tweak: 'Shotgun slugs and Z8/STS damage has been lowered slightly to accomodate
      for their higher penetration. In general ballistics deal less damage but have
      higher penetration than comparable laser weapons. Notable exception: X-Ray lasers
      have had their damage lowered slightly but gain very high armour penetration.'
  - rscadd: Energy swords now have very high armour penetration. Ninja blades do less
      damage but ignore armour completely.

      own id card module, similar to how syndicate ids work.
  - rscadd: When examined up close id cards now offer a more detailed view.
  - rscadd: Agent ids now offer much greater customization, allowing changing name,
      age, DNA, toggling of AI tracking termination (using the electronic warfware
      option), and more.
  - rscadd: As AI tracking can now be enabled/disabled at will AI players should not
      feel the need to hesitate before informing relevant crew members when camera

  atlantiscze:

      mode before exploding during delamination.

      of RNG (8 - 12 minutes on high strength EMP)

2016-06-28:
  Cirra/:
  - rscadd: Added a chemistry gripper for Crisis borgs.
  HarpyEagle:
  - rscadd: Adds applying pressure to body parts to reduce bleeding. With desired
      body part selected, help-intent click yourself or get an aggressive grab, then
      help-intent attack with the grab item. Each person should only be able to apply
      pressure to one body part on one person at a time, so choose wisely. Applying
      pressure will get blood on your hands.
  - rscadd: Splints and hardsuits that support broken limbs will automatically apply
      pressure.
  - rscadd: Wounds that require treatment (e.g. bandage) to stop bleeding will be
      bolded in the examine output. Wounds that will eventually stop bleeding on their
      own are not bolded.
  - tweak: Rigsuits now only support limbs when online.
  Haswell:
  - maptweak: Added NanoMed wall vendors in engineering, security, bridge, bar, arrivals
      and escape hallways, replacing mapped in medkits and medical supplies.

2016-07-03:
  Snapshot:
  - rscadd: Added Neural Laces which are an intented optional config togglable replacement
      to the cloning system. Neural laces are a mechanical backup of a character's
      memories and personality that can be exchanged between bodies.
  - rscadd: Added Neural Lace Surgery mechanic which works the same way as implant
      surgery.
  - rscadd: Added Neural Relacing Machine which will automate the procedure above
      and can be constructed through R&D.
  - tweak: Health Analyzers will show if a subject has a neural lace.
  - rscadd: Neural laces can be implanted in someone without a neural lace with a
      30% chance of taking over their body

2016-07-06:
  Ccomp5950:
  - bugfix: Cleanbots will no longer obsess over dirt under doors/lockers or other
      areas they cannot access.
  Hubblenaut:
  - rscadd: Racks will automatically align their contents.
  - tweak: Tables use an invisible 8x8 grid for item placement.
  - tweak: Items spawning or placed in closets will not be pixelshifted.
  - tweak: Certain items will now always be placed centered (This is mostly reserved
      for items with sprites too big to be handy for grid placement).
  - tweak: Flips rack icon to be consistent with other sprites.
  - bugfix: Sets center_of_mass for tools and chemistry reagent containers.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: Uplink services now all spawn a proper item which can be used to trigger
      the relevant effect at a desired time, as opposed to it firing immediately.
  - tweak: The jammer item has been moved into the 'Devices and Tools' category.
  - tweak: The jammer services have been moved into the 'Services' category.

  - rscadd: Adds the item_worth var and get_worth proc to obj subtypes and mob/living
2016-07-08:
  Asanadas:
  - rscadd: Added two pairs of forensic gloves for detectives to use, ceasing their
      self-incrimination. Replacements can be found in the cargo detective crates.
  TheWelp:
  - tweak: Rebalances leap to respect handcuffs, ability to walk, etc.

      dyed Vox hair! Within reason.
2016-07-09:
  HarpyEagle:
  - rscadd: Severe enough burn damage now causes one-time blood loss due to blistering
      and body fluid cook-off.
  - rscadd: Armor that provides 'bio' protection will now protect against the effects
      of slime feeding. Slimes can still glomp you, however, and are still dangerous
      even if you are wearing biohazard suits.
2016-07-12:
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Random event probabilities have been changed a bit. This is mostly noticeable
      with electrical storms, which should be less common now.
  - tweak: Electrical storm now shuts down APCs for longer duration which is controlled
      by event severity. APCs with critical flag are now affected too, but are only
      shut down for a short time in comparison to others.
  - tweak: EMPs are no longer one-hit kills for AIs - APCs with critical flag take
      reduced damage from EMPs, and AI's power restoration routine now resets the
      APC that may have been EMPed.
  - tweak: AI's power usage has been overhauled. Under the hood changes should improve
      reliability a bit and take more scenarios in consideration. The power restoration
      routine now provides better feedback to the AI if it fails, such as, whether
      the APC is broken or only discharged, etc.
  - rscadd: AI now has a Shutdown verb that can be used to reduce it's power usage
      five times. This disables AI's control, cameras, and most communications as
      if it was without power. This verb acts as a toggle, so it can be used again
      to turn yourself back on.
  - rscadd: AI now has Toggle Power Override verb that can be used to disable power
      saving mode when it loses APC power. This results in much faster discharge of
      internal capacitor, but allows you to operate as if you were powered. Can be
      toggled at any time.
2016-07-13:
  HarpyEagle:
  - tweak: Voidsuits and cyber suits are now more shock resistant, now roughly between
      hardsuits and thick clothing.
2016-07-14:
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Shield generator configuration has been tweaked. Shield generators upkeep
      power is reduced considerably (stationwide shield is approx. 1.1MW at full strength).
      Shields still use a lot of power when regenerating.
  - tweak: Shield capacitors now act as actual capacitors. Their power storage is
      2 GJ, and maximal input 4MW, as opposed to 8MJ/400kW it was now.
  - tweak: Shield generator+capacitor UI now displays in kilowatts and megawatts instead
      of watts where applicable.
2016-07-17:
  TheWelp:

2016-07-18:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: The antag uplink now offers a shield disrupter in 'Devices and Tools'
      category. Handy for when that hull shield gets in your way.
  - rscadd: Once an emergency response team has been successfully dispatched, as opposed
      to simply requested, the emergency shuttle cannot be called for 30 minutes.
2016-07-22:
  Daranz:
  - bugfix: FixOVeins can now be used for attaching robotic organs (such as neural
      laces) in organic patients. Follow the same procedure as with normal organ transplant.

  - maptweak: Replaced 'small rubber stamp' with corresponding new ones in cargo area
      and warden's office.
  - maptweak: Placed a 'DENIED' stamp in captain's office.
  - spellcheck: Renamed ''quartermaster's stamp'' to ''quartermaster's rubber stamp''.
  Snapshot:
  - rscadd: Moved airlock electronics, brig doors, portable canisters, and cargo computers
      over to TGUI
  - tweak: Cargo ordering computers have been completely reworked. Both the supply
      and ordering computer have been merged into one which can be logged into or
      out of by a crew member with cargo access. The computers will allow only one
      computer to be logged in as a register at a time and orders cannot be placed
      without a register active.
  - tweak: The cargo ordering system has been tweaked to allow requests even when
      there are not enough points available so that cargo can queue items into their
      cart at their discretion. Items moved to the cart can be demoted back to requests
      as well.
  - rscadd: The cargo computer now allows crew members to print a receipt of their
      requests for their onw use.
  - soundadd: Added sounds for printing from the cargo computer for more ambient sounds.
  - experiment: The cargo computer will quietly beep whenever a successful ui button
      press is completed. This is an experimental test to see if more ambience can
      be added without becoming too much of an annoyance.
  atlantiscze:
  - rscadd: Adds maintenance braces. These can be printed by research and used to
      lock down an airlock. Braces can be removed with paired keycard or maintenance
      jack tool (also available from research). Braces prevent the airlock from opening
      via any means, and absorb a lot of damage until they break off, protecting the
      airlock.
2016-07-23:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: Some antag uplink weapons now come with ammunition (and a container to
      hold them) and their price and description has been updated accordingly.
  - tweak: Buying random items from the antag uplink will no longer give you weapons
      without relevant ammunition, or ammunition for weapons you may not have.
2016-07-25:
  Superbee29:
  - rscadd: Ghosts can now see the power in a cable when examining it.
2016-07-29:
  Raptor1628:
  - tweak: Replaced Tactical Armor sprites and stats. Overall less protective.
  - rscadd: Adds new gas mask sprite.
  - tweak: Adjusted helmet and armor values. Helmets match their armors a bit more,
      but are usually more protective.
  - tweak: Adjusts armored vests for the torch and splits ballistic/ablative armor
      into vest and full-body versions.
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Add Antagonist vote can no longer be freely called by players. It can still
      be called by admins, or as an alternative to crew transfer.
  - tweak: Add Antagonist is no longer an alternative to crew transfer during Extended
      gamemode. The intention is to keep that gamemode antagonist-free, as it was
      originally intended.
  - rscadd: Players in the lobby will now see which antagonist types were added to
      the game. This is displayed below the gamemode's name in the Lobby tab.
2016-08-01:
  HarpyEagle:
  - rscadd: Emagged and traitor synths can no longer be locked down, except by physically
      cutting the lockdown wire (merely pulsing will not work).

2016-08-06:
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Added status display icons for green, blue and delta alerts.
  - rscadd: Status displays now have coloured lights for alert icons.
  Zuhayr, GinjaNinja32, and Snapshot:
  - rscadd: Implemented full body prosthetics. Full Body prosthetics (FBPs) allow
      replacement of the entire body with cyborg components and replacement of internal
      organs with synethic or assisted counterparts. Players can create a FBP character
      by selecting full body in the limbs section of character preferences.
  - rscadd: FBPs gain the benefits of a stronger body and no longer requiring breathing,
      but are prone to overheating much like IPCs and can take pressure damage in
      space. If you play an FBP, be sure to wear a suit and cooler!
  - rscadd: IPC monitor screens are now a seperate object in the loadout menu. IPCs
      can select a variety of other heads from other prosthetic manufacturing companies
      to change their head and body appearance.
  - imageadd: IPC monitor screens have an object sprite that's synced to their mob
      sprite.
  - tweak: Rebalanced IPC brute and burn modifiers due to the introduction of FBPs.
      These settings may be tweaked again in the future after gameplay has been conducted.
2016-08-07:
  Asanadas:
  - bugfix: 'Brings an end to the deadly feud between two of the Exodus''s mascots:
      Pun pun, and Officer Beepsky.'
2016-08-08:

      on or off.
  Techhead:
  - rscadd: Ghosts can flicker lights when the round is spooky enough.
2016-08-11:

  Asanadas:
  - rscadd: Neural laces can now be destructed and created in a proper research lab.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: Invented supermatter grenades and made them available to certain sets
      of antags.
  - rscadd: The antag uplink now allows you to also buy x1 grenades, in addition to
      the x5 sets, with some markup.
  TheWelp:
  - rscadd: Adds ability for merchants to fast buy via cash using a banking system.
  - rscadd: Adds ability for players to sell things to merchants. They will only take
      things they like.
2016-08-18:
  Haswell:
  - tweak: The autopilot on the escape shuttle can no longer be overridden during
      crew transfers while on blue alert or lower. It can only be overridden during
      an evacuation, or during an alert level higher than blue.
  Karolis2011:
  - rscadd: Added whole map capture tool, only accessable by admins.
2016-08-22:
  Asanadas:
  - rscadd: The Exodus robotics lab has a newly installed Robotech deluxe (we found
      it out in the shed). Also, a new light switch.
2016-08-26:
  Asanadas:
  - rscadd: Dug out an old engineering vending machine and added it to the engineering
      workshop.
  Soadreqm:
  - rscadd: Made tape recorders use removable 10-minute cassettes instead of 60-minute
      internal storage.
  TheWelp:
  - rscadd: Adds four new traders, a robot trader, a pet trader, a replica trader,
      and a prank trader.
  - rscadd: Adds unique items (and a bot) for the traders to sell.
  - rscadd: Adds missing item worth values to the list.
  - tweak: Unique NPCs now stay around for twice as long.
  - tweak: Tweaks Hostile mob AI, so that if they have no faction at all, they will
      target nobody.
  - tweak: Spawner grenade can now set variables (using a list) upon spawning whatever
      it spawns.
2016-08-28:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: Telecrystal amount increased from 25 too 100 with uplink costs adjusted
      accordingly, all to allow even more price differentiation.
  - tweak: A five pack of grenades is now 20% cheaper than buying them one at a time.
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Power cell no longer use magical charge units. Instead they are rated in
      WattHours. For example, a cell with rating of 1000 will be capable of providing
      1000 watts for one hour. (or 2000 watts for half a hour, etc.)
  - tweak: In general this means that a power cell with rating of 1000 will hold MUCH
      more energy than it held before. To balance this out, power cell capacities
      have been reduced considerably. When these two changes add up the cells last
      for approximately same time as they used to.
  - tweak: As part of this change, higher grade power cells have became a bit more
      rare. Research can still fabricate them in bulk, but they are much rarer from
      random spawns, and no longer available from vending machines. Vending machines
      provide standard cells instead. EngiVend can be hacked to provide few high capacity
      ones.
  - tweak: Vending machines no longer shoot objects at people when malfunctioning.
      They merely shudder and dump the item on the ground. This should make the random
      event a little bit less annoying.
  - tweak: Space heater's default temperature setting is now 20C (changed from 50C),
      which is the default station temperature. It can still be changed via the UI
      when the panel is open.
2016-08-29:
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Added /vg/ direct-action ventcrawling. You will now crawl through the
      actual pipe network, a step at a time. Have fun.
2016-08-30:
  Haswell:
  - rscdel: Atmospheric technician is now unavailable for general play.
  - rscadd: Alt title 'Atmospheric Technician' is now added to engineers.
  - tweak: Engineers now have all the accesses atmospheric technicians previously
      held.
  - tweak: Tweaked job selection screen to properly indicate which jobs aren't available
      to play as.
  Kelenius:
  - tweak: Cultists don't need to research words anymore.
  - tweak: Astral journey's damage over time lowered to sane levels.
  - tweak: Changeling revive, when the timer is up, will now give you a verb that
      revives you, allowing you to choose when to get up, instead of doing it immediately.
  - tweak: Changelings will always get DNA, species, and languages together, be it
      via absorbtion, DNA sting, or hive channel.
  - tweak: Changeling transform and change species was merged.
  - tweak: Changelings no longer display gender in changeling chat.
2016-09-02:
  Techhead:
  - rscadd: Medical splints can now also be applied to hands and feet (in addition
      to arms and legs).
  - rscadd: For those that miss the old functionality, ghetto splints have been added.
      These can be crafted with a roll of tape and a metal rod and can only splint
      arms and legs.
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Converts few other things over to work with the recent CELLRATE change.
      This fixes various issues where battery life of some things (drills, etc.) was
      very short, while some other things had power cells with very large capacities.
  - tweak: Hardsuits and Mechas now use energy in joules rather than Wh (this fixes
      Ninja suit, among others). Various exosuit tools now have rebalanced power usage.
      Energy based exosuit weapons use energy on per-shot basis, ballistic weapons
      use single massive spike when fabricating a new magazine.
  - tweak: Minor power-related changes to exosuit modules. Energy cost of some offensive
      modules increased a bit.
  - tweak: Added short cooldown for teleporter module to prevent spamming.
  - tweak: Added power usage to various industrial/science modules (anomaly scanner,
      various drills, etc.).
  - tweak: Increased mounted RCD power usage by a lot (matter fabrication is very
      power demanding process).
  - tweak: Powersink module is limited to 120kW transfer rate, and is slower (30kW)
      when used on APCs with enabled interface lock. Furthermore, when draining from
      APC it first tries to take energy from the grid, before resorting to taking
      it from the cell.
  - bugfix: APCs drained by a ninja no longer get stuck on 0% charge, and instead
      recharge themselves as usual.
  - rscadd: Repair capability of upgraded cyborg rechargers now also works on IPCs
      and FBPs.
  - tweak: If the cyborg recharger is upgraded enough, it will be capable of rebooting
      (and eventually repairing) destroyed modules, for some extra power.
2016-09-03:
  Haswell:
  - rscadd: Added a fashion vending machine in the locker room for snowflake loadout
      items.

  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Added a hawaii shirt to loadout accessories. Can be attached to clothing
      like suit jackets etc. Can also be found in mixed wardrobes.
  Cirra:
  - rscadd: Spiderlings now have a unique sprite specific to the type of giant spider
      they will become.
  Kelenius:
  - rscadd: Ninjas now have access to a PDA that has an empty uplink (for exploitable
      information).

2016-09-10:
  Cirra:
  - rscadd: Resomi now process reagents twice as fast.

      future.
  - tweak: Picks renamed to show their excavation depths.
  - tweak: Suspension generator's power use lowered.
  - tweak: Suspension generator's different field types removed. By the way, remember
      that they can suspend any item and even mobs.
  - tweak: Archeology belts and pick sets can now hold small pickaxes. Pick sets still
      only have 7 slots. Brushes fit on your ears.
  - tweak: Empty rock drop rate reduced.
  - tweak: Empty rock renamed from 'rock' to 'small rock' so you can tell if you are
      clicking on a turf or an item when hovering over it.
  - tweak: Empty boulder spawn rate reduced.
  - tweak: Tape measuring is a bit faster.
  - tweak: Scanner now shows the lowest and the highest depth of the find (highest
      is depth + clearance) for easier calculations. Ideally, you need to hit exactly
      the lowest spot. Less ideally, hit anywhere between higest and lowest. Hit below
      lowest and you have a chance to break the find.
  - tweak: You can now use a brush to clear strange rocks. Welder uses less fuel for
      that than before.
  - tweak: Anomaly analyser's report made a bit easier to read.
  - tweak: Anomaly locater will now also locate normal finds.
  - bugfix: Gas masks will now correctly spawn as archeological finds.
  - bugfix: Digsites will now properly contain several (4-12) turfs in a 5x5 radius.
      Be careful when digging near your finds.
  - bugfix: Suspension generator will now correctly turn off (qdel issue).
  - bugfix: Archeology overlays won't disappear when the icon is updated (e.g. when
      mining next to it).
  - bugfix: Archeology overlays won't overlap each other and will properly disappear
      when you mine out a find.
  - bugfix: Some spawning oddities were fixed.
  - bugfix: Checks for whether you get a strange rock or a clean item were fixed (previously
      it always gave you clean item where it should have been rolling a random number).
  - bugfix: Can no longer get rid of any item by putting it into evidence bag and
      bag into core sampler.
  - bugfix: CO2 generator effect now has a type.
  - bugfix: Phoron generator effect will now always generate phoron, not sometimes
      phoron and sometimes oxygen.
  - tweak: You can now lit smokables with cigarettes and cigars.
  - tweak: You can now explode welder tanks with all flame sources (cigarettes, lighters,
      candles, igniters, etc).
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: The impaired Resomi vision is now represented by the oxygen overlay rather
      than the welding overlay.
  - tweak: Vision impairment from wearing a welding mask now stacks with nearsightedness
      due to now being two separate effects.
  - tweak: Species and individual specific nearsightedness now stacks, i.e. a nearsighted
      Resomi won't be aided at all to the same degree by the standard prescription
      glasses as other species would be.
  - tweak: Glasses can now have varying degrees of prescription.
2016-09-11:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: Equipment that doesn't check a specific id card for access now checks
      the collective access of all id cards in both hands and the id slot. Among other
      things such equipment includes doors.
2016-09-14:
  Cirra:
  - bugfix: Nurse spiders should now correctly have a chance to implant eggs on attack.
  Zuhayr:

  Cirra:
  - rscadd: Service grippers can now hold straws and sticks.
  Haswell:
  - rscadd: Added coin mint to the mining outpost.
  - rscadd: Borosilicate (phoron) glass can now be made with the mineral processor.
  atlantiscze:
  - rscadd: Created new AI restorer program, by default available on research consoles.
      Also added a new hardware piece that acts as connection between intellicard
      and a computer (laptop and console only). The new program allows AI restoration,
      as well as simple law modifications. It can also be used to purge malfunctioning
      AI's laws correctly. This program can only work on intellicarded AIs, that are

2016-11-04:

  Datraen:
  - tweak: Skrell now have mild darksight.
  - tweak: Skrell now prefer slightly warmer temperatures.
2016-11-08:
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Blobs are now considerably more resistant to energetic weapons, be it handheld
      lasers, energy guns, or even emitters. An emitter is still useful to suppress
      the blob a bit, but one emitter shouldn't be capable of outright killing the
      blob.
  - rscadd: Blob has a relatively small chance to grow secondary cores. These cores
      are considerably weaker, have lower health, but still help spread the blob a
      bit more.
  - tweak: Emitter power usage increased (30kW to 100kW). While it is still possible
      to run one with PACMAN, you have to keep it on overload.
  - tweak: Reinforced walls are now considerably more resistant against projectiles
      of all kinds, be it emitters, handheld weaponry, or anything else. Regular walls
      are unaffected. An emitter is still useful if you need to burn through one,
      but expect to wait - it needs over fifty pulses for a plasteel reinforced wall.
  - tweak: Details on the above. Reinforcement is calculated from the material that
      is used to reinforce the girders when building the wall. Weak materials such
      as wood have 0% reduction in taken damage. Most basic materials have 50% or
      so. Steel is decent material with 80% reduction. Plasteel is very good with
      90%, and titanium is the best with approx. 92% reduction (though it has lower
      overall health)
  - rscdel: Removed bubble shield generators, hull shield generators and shield capacitors.
      Also removed shield disrupter.
  - rscadd: Added a replacement advanced shield generator, that has a combined function
      of a capacitor, and both shield generators (hull shielding is toggleable). This
      shield generator must be built and once constructed is immobile (but can be
      deconstructed again). These generators are fully configurable, have better hull
      shielding that doesn't block shuttles, mass drivers and others, and have different
      energy system. Damage will drain the shield's energy directly.
  - rscadd: Added Shield Diffusers. Two variants exist - floor mounted and handheld.
      The handheld variant can be purchased from traitor uplink, and runs on an internal
      cell. The floor mounted variant layers under floor tiles and is APC powered.
      These diffusers dissipate shields in adjacent tiles (+ shaped pattern). The
      generator can be set to try to counter these, in which case each diffuser causes
      major EM strain on the shield.
  - maptweak: Added two shield generator circuit boards and two shield diffuser circuit
      boards into tech storage.

      create a small bit of heat to get fuel to its burn temperature (126C).
  - tweak: Added relief valve to air tanks. They now trigger leak logic at over 173C
      or leak pressure. Can be welded shut to prevent leakage.

  - tweak: The gibber is now called a meat grinder, since that's what it is.
  - tweak: Eating a human organ or limb is now done in the exact same manner as any
      other food. If you try to eat a limb, though, it will not be usable in a transplant,
      for obvious reasons.
  - tweak: Human organs now fit into the reagent grinder.

  - tweak: Added a small delay between the slime latch and the first damage dealt.
  - tweak: Changed how slimes react to damage. Slimes that are attacked with something
      will sometimes be shaken off their victims (chance is force * 5 - anything with
      force or 20 or above is a guaranteed shake-off).
  - tweak: Disarming a slime or wrestling them off now has a chance to disorient them
      for a moment. Throwing them off with a weapon doesn't do that.
  - tweak: Water will make slimes lose their target, stop feeding, and will disorient
      them for a moment on the first application (they will not be stunlocked and
      repeated applications have no effect).
  - tweak: Slimes now twice as weak to water - PLEASE remember that spraying them
      more than once is a waste, the water is already on them and killing them.

      of failure. Some steps are more robust, some are more delicate. As a rule of
      a thumb, if you have to touch innards, that''s delicate. If you perform internal
      organ surgery on yourself while sitting on a table piss drunk, nearly passing

      in each loop is roughly 1.5

  - rscadd: All toys guns are now fitted with red bits on the barrel so you can visually
      tell them apart! Very safe! Fun for whole family!
  - rscadd: Can use wirecutters on toy revolvers to snip those off. It also changes
      examine name to 'revolver' instead of 'toy gun'. In case you didn't know, those
      are proper guns and you can hold people hostage with those. Just saying. Do
      not try at home.
  Cirra:
  - tweak: Attempting to place an airlock brace without setting an access requirement
      now informs you, and asks for confirmation.
  Orelbon:
  - rscadd: Added inhand sprite for stun rifle.
  Ornias1993:
  - bugfix: Everyone including military can now take sunglasses from loadout.
2017-05-23:
  Asanadas:
  - tweak: Maintenance Drones now require an account of age 3 days or greater.
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Bunch of virus changes. Buckle up, kiddo. Praise Nurgle
  - rscadd: Adds Space Cold event. Spawns a harmless virus that can be treated with
      cold medicine. Unless you're irradiated and it mutates to kill everyone I guess.
  - rscadd: Adds space cold medicine (dextra-something) to white first aid boxes.
      Can also be made by mixing paracetamol+sugar. Eating it will stop weak viruses
      symptoms from manifesting.
  - rscadd: Humans now have crude immune system simulation. Keeping your immunity
      high makes it easier to shrug off viruses, extremely low (15% and less) immunity
      can get you random space cold-level infections. Get lemons for boosting it,
      spaceacilin ruins it. It recovers to norm over time.
  - tweak: Spaceacillin now ODs at 15u instead of 30u.
  - tweak: Spaceacillin now metabolizes faster. It was 60+ minutes for 15u, 30 minutes
      now.
  - tweak: Spaceacillin boosts immune system effective rating. It acts as a multiplier
      to natural one, from 1x at none in blood to 2x at OD threshold (15u), and you
      can go higher if you don't mind ODing. Also if natural immunity is lower than
      the boost, boost would just replace it.
  - tweak: Spaceacillin has three stages now. Below 10 units it acts kinda like now,
      blocking badness 2 virus effects. Virus would still progress though, but effects
      won't fire. It's enough for any random event virus effects.
  - tweak: Above 10 units it would completely stop progression of badness 2 viruses
      and stop effects of badness 3 - which is usual stuff ou get from viro labs.
      Again, clock will still be ticking. Also at this stage it starts lowering your
      natural immunity value.
  - tweak: And then, there's OD. OD stops badness 4 (e.g. Gibbingtons) from manifesting,
      and stops ticking of lower viruses. It screws your immune system even stronger
      too.
  - tweak: It's also not 100% protecting you from infection now. 15u and above give
      old 100% protection, scaling with lower value in blood.
  - tweak: Some tweaks to virus annoyningness. Hard delay between firings (25-40 seconds
      between message-only syndromes), emote syndromes (groaning, moaning, screaming)
      are now single syndrome to make it rarer. Internals actually stopping you from
      spreading viruses. No airborne viruses in vacuum.
  - tweak: As an unrealated bonus, first aid (white and fire) boxes now have paracetamol
      bottles because damn it's easier to score opiates than that.
  - tweak: Oh also remember how when you graft yourself Tajaran arms it kills you?
      Not when your immunity is floored. Just saying.
  Orelbon:
  - maptweak: Tech storage has been moved to deck two, where the abandoned officers
      mess was located. The officers mess has been moved into the previous location
      of tech storage.

  - maptweak: Engineering locker room and storage have been tweaked.

      sheets.

2017-06-17:
  Asanadas:
  - bugfix: No longer will you be able to freely pass onto upright tables by moving
      onto them from a tile which has a flipped table.
  Chaoko99:
  - rscadd: Added a mass-defile cultist rune. Buyer beware; it may kill you.
  - rscadd: Cult tiles play a snazzy animation on creation.
  - rscadd: The soulstone shard now notifies the player when it is full, asks if you
      wish to release the spirit within.
  - rscdel: Removed Manifests from the cultist repertoire.
  - rscdel: Removed defile giving cultist levels.
  - tweak: Changed the values for cultiness (The value which controls spell levels).
      You will need to either recruit 10 cultists, or perform 10 sacrifices to unlock
      Nar-Sie.
  - tweak: Nerfed cultist robes. Buffed cultist voidsuits. The latter of which is
      still impossible to obtain.
  - bugfix: Made the restricted/protected/blacklisted roles for cultists torch-compatible.
  - bugfix: Fixed construct and familiar spells.
  - rscdel: Removed Vox Pariah.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Can now rig assemblies/devices(e.g. radio signalers) to trigger when crate
      is opened. Click wires on open crate, then click with assemblies. It would trigger
      when opened next time. Use wirecutter to unrig.
  - tweak: AI cores got new step in construction. You need to swipe an ID with Upload
      access (or emag) to hook them into the systems.
  - rscadd: Added rubber masks and suits to party crate. Dress up as war hero or SCG
      secretary or a naked tajara like you always wanted.
  - tweak: Made SHOCK mode on tasers literally useless, ruining security gameplay.
      Does bit less burn damage, and much less straight up stun damage. Not 'better
      tase mode' anymore.
  - bugfix: Fixed their primary function actually never working. If you hit arm or
      hand with the beam you can disarm someone (even diona, even robbit, pain reception
      doesn't matter). If you hit leg, they might drop, higher chance for foot.
  Hubblenaut:
  - bugfix: Manifold pipes show up properly on t-ray scanners now.
  - bugfix: Space lube now properly disappears.
  - tweak: Can now put items in vendors by using click and drop, thus allowing screwdrivers,

  sabiram:
  - rscadd: Research module robots now have access to a welding tool.
2017-06-19:
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Speed now matters when flying into meteor field. Still - 25% the meteors,
      below 0.3 - 60% of usual, normal otherwise until above 3 speed, where you start
      getting double the fun. Also if ship is moving most meteors will fly in from
      front and sides.
  - tweak: Changes spess dust event. It used to be a single wave of quasi-meteors
      that exploded for a bit before dying. There were no further waves until you
      left and came back. Now waves keep coming ~twice a minute. Dust itself is now
      a pile of micrometeors - basically space bullets. It wouldn't do a lot of damage
      to the hull, but can break windows and makes EVA pretty damn dangerous.
  - tweak: SCG had mastered the secret art of 'background check'. CO and XO are no
      longer be eligible for roundstart antag roles on Torch. Can still be converted
      in round
  - bugfix: As a side effect, they aren't going to get rev'd anymore, that was a bug.
  ZeroBits:

  - rscadd: Added threebread, blueberries, pancakes, and two new flavors of ice-cream.
2017-06-30:
  Chaoko99:
  - tweak: Poppies now contain tramadol.
  - bugfix: Fixed the phrasing in the set-pose verb.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: NT has sent some more testing supplies. Nothing to see really. RDs can
      find details in a super secret folder in their office. Others - do no peek,
      ok.
  - tweak: Surgery now produces normal wounds instead of snowflake 'open incisions'.
      Do not be alarmed, do not bandage those if you plan to continue surgery, clamp.
      If incision was made with scalpel, you'll be able to cauterize it, healing a
      lot of damage.
  - tweak: Skull/ribs surgery changed, now you just need to use the saw to crack em.
      Fractures count as being open too. Retractor steps for ribs etc are gone, use
      normal bone repair surgery aferwards.
  - tweak: Coincidently you can just rip them apart with cut wounds to get access
      to innard surgery steps. It takes much more damage than surgical incisions though.
  - tweak: Bones now fracture when damage is taken rather than from existing damage.
      Meaning if you fix bones, they won't refracture immediately without taking damage.
  - tweak: You don't need to crack open the bones to get shrapnel now. If you can
      see it on examine, you can take it out with just a retracted incision.
  - rscadd: Added new surgery step - disinfecting wounds. You can use sterilizine
      or high proof booze, in spraybottles/droppers/bottles/glasses/buckets. Works
      same as ointment.
  ParadoxSpace:
  - rscadd: Adds darksight to space adapted humans
  Ravensdale:
  - tweak: Cultists now speak in the cult tongue when activating runes instead of
      their default language. Done in case a changeling cultist ever becomes a thing.
  - rscdel: Removed special human kabobs and burgers. Lumping all items that are 'red
      meat' together.
  - tweak: Adjusted AI tracking verbs. AI will now have a more difficult time tracking
      specific people depending on method and if person has their face concealed.
  - tweak: To bring some consistency for the above, also adjusted how names appear
      on mobs that have some sort of face covering or a face that is... not there.
  Zucchinsky:
  - rscadd: Beeg medical changes. Like holy crap. Get a crash course on https://wiki.baystation12.net/index.php?title=Zuhmed_Guide
  - rscadd: Death now occurs when brain dies. Brain's health replaces overall 'health'
  - rscadd: Death is now FINAL, baring relacing. Don't let that brain die.
  - rscadd: Crit now exists as flatlining, the heart failure, or as fancily 'asystole'.
      It happens when heart is damaged, not enough blood or oxygen in blood, or high
      levels of shock.
  - rscadd: In crit you do the usual gasping thing and take brain damage. USE CRP
      or defib to revive em. If they die before you crack ribs, you hadn't tried hard
      enough.
  - rscadd: '''Toxins'' damage is now overall organ failure, basically sum of organ
      damage. Poisons will try to destroy liver and kidney first, and will damage
      the rest after those two are down. Some poisons go straight for vitals. Liver
      will heal self until it''s too damaged.'
  - rscadd: '''Suffocation'' damage is now used as modifier to your blood levels.
      If you don''t get enough air, you get effects of low blood basically.'
  - rscadd: Defibs now restart failed hearts instead of reviving dead. Also named
      differently now.
  - rscadd: Most scanner readouts are changed now. Instead of damage values they report
      vitals (pulse/blood pressure/brain activity) and general state of damage.
  - rscadd: A D R E N A L I N E. When you take a good chunk of damage at once (15
      or more in one hit) you generate bit of adrenaline reagent according to damage
      taken. It acts like strong painkiller / pulse raiser for a tick or two, becoming
      weaker after that.
  - rscadd: FBPs and IPCs now have batteries in their chests. They have HYPERCELLS
      and drain when they stand (unbuckled) or move around (double drain then).
  - rscadd: Sleepers now have stomach pumps, same as filtering but for ingested stuff.
  - rscadd: Cultists yo - sacrifice rune now works on someone in asystole rather than
      full braindeath. Knives now count for all steps needed to cut out the heart,
      and cult runes count as surgery spots. Just sayin'.
  - rscadd: Bunch of chems is different now. First off, none 'reduce' toxins damage,
      aside from peridaxon cause tht's organ damage now.
  - rscadd: Peridaxon only treats brain damage if it's not too severe. Get Alkysine
      otherwise.
  - rscadd: Alkysine will only work if brain is fully oxygenated, so refill blood
      and air first.
  - rscadd: Dylovene removes toxic reagents from blood.
  - rscadd: Dexlaine fools brain into thinking you got at least 50% of air you needed.
      For Dex+ it's 80%.
  - rscadd: Cryox/Clonex also have Dex/Dex+ effect respectively.
  - rscadd: Inapro prevents suffocating while in asystole, slows pulse down (which
      slows bleeding a bit) and has mild painkiller effect as it did.
2017-07-06:
  Chaoko99:
  - tweak: Added a full belt to engineering lockers.

      that.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Can now scoop corgis up, like cats or nymphs etc.

      hehehe hot dogs. Riot.
  - tweak: GUPpy, Calypso and Aquila now can share destinations, as long as they can
      fit.
  - rscadd: Excavation prep closets now have BLUESPACE FLARES. You can activate those
      in a nice open spot to create a new navpoints for shuttles (ones mentioned)
      to go to.
  - rscadd: Exploration shuttles (Calypso/Guppy/Aquila) now can share destinations
      (with some other shuttles too).

2017-07-09:
  Chaoko99:
  - tweak: Made it so a butterfly knife spawns in your hand instead of on the floor
      when completed.
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Bluespace jump effects have changed. Engineers found that some duct tape
      got unstuck because of a WD40 leak, so they fixed it. Now you can't zoom through
      the walls, and visibility is a bit better. You also don't get confused forever,
      just for a minute or so. There are some... unforseen side effects, but they
      seem harmless. A word from Chief Tech (before his disappearace) - KEEP IT REAL.
  Hubblenaut:
  - rscadd: Gives holowarrants their own handheld item.
  - tweak: Holowarrants will now broadcast updates on warrants instead of security
      HUDs.

  - tweak: Atmospherics pressure tanks can now be set to output up to 15000kPa
  Heptagon49:
  - bugfix: Changes the recipes for Methylphenidate and Antidexafen so they no longer
      overlap. Methyl now requires lithium instead of hydrazine, and antidexafen now
      requires carbon instead of sugar.
  - tweak: Lowered the max damage of internal organs, except for the brain and cortical
      stack.
  - tweak: Prosthetic internal organs are now stronger then regular organs.
  - tweak: Kidneys are actually important now. You will slowly take toxin damage if
      they are missing or busted, same as the liver.
  - imageadd: Changed the sprites for the prosthetic liver and kidneys.
  - rscadd: Prosthetic lungs half the toxin damage taken from breathing bad air.
  - tweak: Made assisted organs slightly worse.
  Hubblenaut:
  - tweak: Air shutters will not be automatically opened by a clearing air alarm when
      it would be dangerous to do.
  ParadoxSpace:
  - rscadd: Unathi across the galaxy have realised the implications of having tails,
      and now use them to attack instead of their legs.
  atlantiscze:
  - rscadd: Can now order OCP and plasteel from cargo. Furthermore, 10 and 50 sheet
      crates are available for some more expensive sheet types, with 50 sheet crates
      being more cost efficient.
  mkalash:
  - tweak: Replaced tgui ticket panel with an autoupdating basic Topic() one
  - rscadd: Added time stamps to messages on the ticket panel, and a measure of how
      long an unanswered ticket has been open

      down.

      program does it.
  - rscadd: 'Added new program to the modular computer framework: NTNet Access Decrypter.
      This program is available for download on all emagged devices, but relies on
      ID card slot hardware. When executed it slowly (takes about 3-6 minutes, depending
      on the device''s CPU) hacks the network and when finished adds a random access
      to the ID. ID must be kept inside the device while running. Can be repeatedly
      used to get multiple accesses. Has chance of yielding access that''s already
      present on the ID, and therefore will do nothing wasting some time.'
  Broseph Stylin:
  - rscadd: Added weight lifting machines and punching bags. They provide no mechanical
      benefits, and will deplete your nutrition as they're used. The weight machine
      has 3 setting which can be changed with a wrench. You must be on harm intent
      to use the punching bags.

      even when their face is obstructed, assuming they are at least wearing a matching
      ID.
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Slimetoxin. Slimetoxin changed. Instead of pop and go slimeficiation it's
      now a life threatening process. Slime toxin metabolizes slowly, and deals fair
      bit of toxins damage. For every unit or so metabolized, it mutates one limb.
      Once every limb mutated, there's a 10% every tick to fully mutate into a slimegirl.
      If you're lucky, you might mutate right before death and that'd heal your all
      wounds! That' a great idea!
  Devildabeast:
  - rscadd: Adds a cyborg recharging station to the Auxiliary Head.

      all research by one level. Single-use.
  - rscadd: Added T5 Machine Upgrade ability, behind Machine Overload. Right now only
      works on APC, SMES, Turret, Turret control, Camera. It is easily expandable
      to any machinery in the future.
  - rscadd: Adds four new abilities in a new passive tree. T1 prevents intellicard
      transfers (toggleable), T2 removes BSOD/lockout from APCs, but reduces CPU generation
      (toggleable), T3 prevents hack failures, and allows you to complete system override
      silently and T4 prevents fax/emergency messages from going through.

  - tweak: Edits the RUST manual to fit the new setup.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - experiment: Overhauls how reagents are identified, affecting both chemistry and
      food. Due to the large scale of these changes more or less subtle bugs may have
      crept their way in.

  Zuhayr:
  - tweak: R-UST backend/manual changes.
2017-09-13:
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Changed way lung damage affects people. Instead of straight up oxyloss,
      it now makes you require higher oxygen pressure - so you can work around it
      with high pressure internals. Of course it's not 100% failsafe, as blood coughing
      and breathing stops still remain.
  - rscadd: Inapro does more things now. It can heal brain damage up to 60, and also
      slows down brain damaging a general, more effective at higher oxygenation.
  - rscadd: Health analyzers report brain damage a bit different now. They don't report
      damage that will self-heal without meds. New stage 'minor brain damage' covers
      range that can be healed with inapro. Rest are more or less same.
  - rscadd: Painstuff tweaked around, should generally see slightly less instant KOs
      from lethal damages.
  FTangSteve:
  - tweak: Makes it so breathing heat or cold will hurt your lungs more than making
      your head explode.
  - rscadd: Electricity now shocks many parts of your body in a line to the ground
      rather than just your hand.

  - maptweak: An Exploration Equipment area which can only be accessed by the Exploration
      department has been mapped on Deck 4 Aft.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Pulse now affects blood circulation. Lower pulse effectively lowers it
      and vice versa.
  - rscadd: Extremely high pulse risks damaging the heart. Shouldn't be a lot, but
      it's there.
  - rscadd: As you lose blood oxygenation, your pulse tries to rise to compensate.
      Thready (>250) pulse will cause a cardiac arrest.
  - rscadd: Inaprovaline tries to bring pulse to normal levels, either up or down.
      It also prevents thready pulse.
  - rscadd: Heart stopping is slightly less 100% surefire, so if you manage to get
      heart restarted it might beat for few ticks first.
  - rscadd: You no longer need lungs/mouth to give CPR, but you will only do the heart
      bit. Checks still apply for mouth-to-mouth.
  - rscadd: Shock stage stars rising earlier now (30 damage vs 50) and can go bit
      higher than usual.
  - rscadd: Painkillers speed changed. Now they ramp up slower if ingested, but stay
      longer. Opposite if injected.
  - rscadd: Tramadol and oxcodone injectors added to medical vendomats (and tramadol
      ones to hacked firstaid vendomats).
  - rscadd: Adds some goodies to survival boxes - inapro injector, food and light.
  - rscadd: Changed how tramadol/oxycodone work a bit. They now have period for setting
      in and wearing off, gradually ramping power up/down. Those are short, ~20 seconds
      to reach max
  - rscadd: Mixing those with alcohol is now as bad idea as it's supposed to be -
      increased liver damage and respiratory depression (harder time beathing) await
      you
  - rscadd: Inaprovaline helps against breathing effects of both mixing and ODing.
  - rscadd: There's now some effects based on how much you consume over time, rather
      than single dose. Effects stat at 15u with some slowdown and chance to start
      slurring, ramp up from there, with major slowdown and slurring after OD-worthy
      doses is metabolized.
  - rscadd: Also ODing on those will give you even MORE painkilling effect! At a small
      cost of suffocating most likely, and don't even try doing that AND booze.
  - rscadd: Ships now have sensors. Overmap is dark by default, with known sectors
      emitting some light. Dust/rocks/ion block visibility. You can control the sensor
      with console(s) on the bridge, its power setting sets how far it will shine.
      Higher settings use /huge/ mounts of power so don't leave it running on those.
      Sensors also cannot run in non-vacuum.
  - rscadd: Some improvements to helm console - now shows ETA to next grid, can set
      max speed for autopilot.
  - rscadd: Engines are now buildable - there's circuitboards for them in Tech storage.
  - rscadd: Merchant prices are now slightly less wack, they use actual procs for
      deciding them, instead of selling containeres full of stuff at price of container
      only.
  - rscadd: Mineral scanners now store survey data, currently useless aside from penile
      comparsions.
  - rscadd: New away mission - a drifting empty ship. Can be restored to fly around
      on its own like Torch.
  atlantiscze:
  - tweak: Cyborgs can now unwrap packages by clicking them..
  dryerlint:
  - tweak: Autolathes can now print cable coils. They are under the Devices and Components
      category.

  - rscadd: Added a service uniform skirt for Expeditionary Corps, available in the
      uniform vendor.
  - rscadd: The clerical module robot now has access to the basic and denied rubber
      stamps. Additionally, their hacked item is now the chameleon stamp.
  - rscadd: The service department has been split. The Sol Pilot, Pathfinder and Explorer
      are now in the Utility department, with their own department radio. The hotkey
      for the utility department is 'y'. Bartender, Cook, Janitor and Crewman remain
      in the service department.

      that attach to it.
  - maptweak: Replaced the armor vests and arm guards found inside the Emergency Armory
      with equivalents using the new modular armor system.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Shrapnel is less deadly now. Tiny items don't jostle around anymore. They
      still prevent wounds they're embedded in from healing.
  - rscdel: Conductive things embedded in body will heat up in EMP, dealing damage
      depending on their size and EMP severity.
  - rscadd: Brainwashing implants! Well, kinda. XO now has a box of 'imprinting' implants,
      that can be set to a list of instructions, and will remind about those to whoever
      is implanted with it. Latest word in grimdark on-job training. They're not binding,
      just reminders.
  - rscadd: Now the fun part is their abuse - when victim has mindbreaker in blood
      and implanted with those, implant wires deep enough to fool host that he actually
      believes these. Think borg laws. You can get the kit in uplink too, bundled
      with a dose of mindbreaker
  - rscadd: Can now emag practice carbines to get lethal lasers out of them. They'll
      turn useless after 3-6 shots so bring a lot! Costs an emag charge.
  - rscadd: Not having enough air in lungs will prevent you from talking efficiently.
      If you don't have air at all, you might use remaining air in lungs for one message.
      If you're just not getting enough, you'll be stuck whispering. Long messages
      might come out garbled.
  FTangSteve:
  - rscadd: Added a push back disarm attack for GAS.
  - rscadd: Added examine text and a message for GAS stance.
  - rscadd: Adds in some of the GAS event things like the threat display and associated

      not interact' to better fit the spirit of the law and staff policy.
2017-10-10:
  Atlantiscze:
  - rscadd: Completely overhauls crew records. Large text fields now support paper
      tag formatting. Records are now accessed through a computer program. Everyone
      can see generic fields (name, job, rank, ..), specialized fields become visible
      depending on your access.
  - rscdel: Removed old record computers of all kinds, removed PDA modules for crew
      record viewing.
  Banditoz:
  - maptweak: Mapped in a camera to Bridge's solar control.
  Broseph Stylin:

      rather than the older vests.
  - rscadd: Plate carriers and storage pouches for them have been added to the loadout,
      priced at 1 and 2 points respectively. Only roles already issued armor can obtain
      them.

  - rscadd: Added doorbell pager button. Press one and it will ping all PDAs of relevant
      department people! There's one in Medical Cargo lobbies each.
  - rscadd: EC ranks have been changed, you'll probably need to update your char settings.
      Only 3 enlisted ranks now, slightly less officer ones.
  - rscadd: 'SUPER IMPORTANT: EC cannot longer be SEA. Also since they don''t have
      O2 equivalent, Pathfinder can be either O1 or O3.'
  - rscadd: Can now rename alien creatures! All exoplanet animals start as 'alien
      creature', and you can use a Name Alien Species verb to rename them when you
      see 'em. Name can't be changed afterwards so don't go too silly. Random generated
      one is suggested when you use that verb too.
  - rscadd: All computers now come with a word processor, NanoWord. Lets you edit
      TXT files, with paper preview and markup help
  CrimsonShrike:
  - rscadd: Ports openspaces. Now open turfs will show whatever is down below.
  Crushtoe:
  - rscadd: Added the antibody analyser, a new way for virology to contribute to the
      crew. Finding new antibodies from curing diseases grants 45 cargo points per
      when scanned, allowing up to 1170 points on the furthest end assuming RNGesus
      is very merciful.
  - maptweak: Mapped in an antibody analyser into the virology lab.
  - rscdel: Removes the Chemist as its own job.

  - tweak: Cryobags, cryo and general stasis changes. Main point is that stasis is
      no longer binary on/off, it doesn't stop life ticking, just slows it down (usually
      a lot). It chemical processing is slowed down too, so sometimes bigger stasis
      is not better.

      On one hand you now NEED to have it in beaker if you care about patient, on
      another - you don't need cryopod if you have those and sufficiently cold place.
  - tweak: Cryobags. Cryobags no longer last forever. Their power drops every 5 minutes
      - examine to see current. It starts at 20x and loses 25% every time, so 20x
      to 15x to 11x in 10 minutes and so on. Will drop into nothingness at ~40 minutes
      mark.

      + gloves.

      Lab. You are not 'discovering' things anymore. You are using high-tech fabricator

      records could be longer, without the skeleton taking up half the usable text.

  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Added methyl bromide, a fumigant gas that kills spiders.
  - rscadd: Added bromide, a toxic reagent, from which can be derived a liquid form
      of methyl bromide. Methyl bromide kills spiderlings and egg sacs when injected.

      bromide.
  - rscadd: Added an interaction to optables that will automatically put someone lying
      on top of it to sleep with no need for N2O or painkillers.
  - rscdel: Removed N2O pumps as being both redundant and buggy.
  afterthought2:

      "Athletics" skill.
  - tweak: Bigger/stronger species pull things faster.
  - rscadd: Pulling stuff generates adrenaline, depending on "Athletics" skill. This
      may raise your heart rate. Pulling for a long time without breaks with low skill
      may give you the jitter effect and minor heart damage (won't kill you).
2018-06-09:
  Banditoz:
  - tweak: The T-Ray scanner is now faster, has an increased range of 7x7, and is

2018-06-11:
  BlueNexus:

  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Now for ghetto EVA the size of thrown thing matters. Tiny things give you
      ~10% chance of direction change, with 'normal' sized things having 90%, guartanteed
      above.
  afterthought2:
  - rscadd: Throwing "huge" items (e.g. roller beds, backpacks, certain guns, rigs,
      jetpacks) or normal sized mobs without "Basic" skill in "Athletics" will briefly
      weaken you (and the items won't go far).
  - rscadd: Thrown items don't go as far and have less speed/force if you have lower
      "Athletics" skill.
  - rscadd: The weightlifting machine at the gym has more weight levels. Having high
      "Athletics" means you can lift more. If you try lifting way more than you are
      capable of, you may hurt yourself.
  sabiram and Cakey:
  - rscadd: The bird temple on the mining map has been redesigned and now houses the
      fountain of youth.

      backpacks.
  afterthought2:
  - rscadd: Lactate is a reagent that increases heart rate, causes generally harmless
      shortness of breath, and slows movement. After processing a large amount of
      lactate, mobs may experience temporary jitters.
  - tweak: Instead of producing adrenaline, pulling produces lactate.
  - rscadd: Robots can now interact with storage items like boxes and bags.
  chaoko99:
  - bugfix: Trays will now adequately notify you of not being able to be placed in
      bags.

  - maptweak: Added binoculars to security checkpoints.
  ZeroBits:
  - tweak: Material Grinders have been reworked to allow different reagent quantities
      and multiple reagents when grinding material sheets
  Zuhayr:
  - tweak: Gas inhalation effects are now reagent-based. Gases create reagents inside
      the body, which then apply effects. This means that gaseous phoron exposure,
      for example, needs to be treated with dialysis/dylovene, as it fills your guts
      up with liquid phoron.
  - tweak: The poison_type var on species datums is now poison_types, and determines
      which poison gasses show you the toxins UI indicator, rather than which ones
      cause poisoning. The actual effects of poisonous gasses is determined by the
      reagent value (as per dexalin being injected into a vox, etc.). This really
      shouldn't impact anything for the average player, except that chlorine and nitrogen
      dioxide (not N2O, for clarity) are now actually poisonous.
  - tweak: Helium now makes your voice squeaky. Very important feature.
  - tweak: Xenon is now functionally the same as N2O, including the following note.
  - tweak: N2O now causes giggling, confusion, dizziness and occasional passing out
      at high dosages, rather than instant and immediate knockout. Still useful for
      riot control and now flooding it into distro isn't a round-ender. You might
      even be able to use it without admins shouting at you! Refer to the optable
      neural suppressor PR for a replacement method to sedate people for surgery.
  - tweak: Finally, as a sidenote, Bogani will actually be poisoned by oxygen and
      chlorine will have a visible overlay now.
  afterthought2:
  - rscadd: Experienced in Chemistry allows you to see scannable reagents in a held
      beaker/container.
  - rscadd: Professional in Chemistry allows you to see all reagents in a held container.
  - tweak: Science goggles give more precise volume readings at higher chem skill.

  - tweak: Grayson, W-T Economy, and Xion are now available at the roboticist fabricator.
  afterthought2:
  - rscadd: The chem grinder is dangerous to use at "Unskilled" in Chemistry and will
      lose some ingredients depending on skill level.
  - rscadd: The chem dispenser will give inaccurate amounts of ingredients or add
      extra contaminating ingredients when below skill "Trained" (in Chemistry or
      Cooking, depending on dispenser)  Can be slightly dangerous.
  - rscadd: The chem master now has two modes. "Quick" will move the correct amount
      of ingredients from beaker to buffer, but also add contaminants (depending on
      skill). "Thorough" will only move the desired ingredient, but incur losses (depending
      on skill). Skill checked is Chemistry for chem master, Cooking for Condimaster.
  - rscadd: Moving ingredients from buffer to waste or beaker acts like on "Quick"
      mode.
2018-06-17:
  ParadoxSpace:
  - rscadd: Adds bowman type headsets to all non-service departments.
  - rscadd: Adds unique pilot, miner, corpsman, and explorer headsets.
  - rscadd: Adds tacticool Syndicate headsets to mercs.

      radio in your pocket, your headset will now automatically transmit through it.
      It still cannot do department channels.
2018-06-18:
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Some loadout items are now restricted by branch instead of jobs. Some are

  - tweak: Adds two new flags for targeted spells to filter via faction.

      target has to be close and there's a short timer during which neither party
      should move.

  - rscadd: Adds a fully reusable backstabbing mechanic, used by butterfly knives
      and switchblades.
2018-06-19:

  - rscdel: 'Removed the time restriction on the following jobs: Explorer, Corpsman,
      Deck Technician, and Scientist.'
  - maptweak: Reorganized the kitchen cabinet and the crates in the Medical Storage
      (the big bag of salt and the defibrillator are no longer blocking everything
      else).
  - maptweak: Removed the anaesthetics closet from the Medical Storage.
  comma:
  - tweak: XO now gets a box of spare headset keys instead of box of XO headsets

      will offset various penalties (not proper optable, improvised tools etc) a bit.
      Time of step is affected by Anatomy skill too.
  - tweak: Some other skills help with some steps, e.g. Trained Forensics offsets
      penalty for incisions, and Complex Devices skill is used instead for robotic
      organ steps, with Electrician and Construction helping with simple limb repair
      steps.
  Chisnky:

      used.
  afterthought2:

      you leave slightly more fingerprints on things, and you will leave prints when
      trying to evidence bag things.
  - rscdel: You need Trained skill to use evidence collection things and forensic
      machines. At higher skill you work microscope faster.
  - rscadd: Offstation antags (and traider) can now become ALIUMS!

      on talking to people.
  afterthought2:

      skill levels give more accurate assessments.
  - tweak: The financial skill has a large effect on your starting cash.
  - tweak: Higher financial skill gives you better deals from traders.
  - rscadd: Using virology machines without sufficient virology skill may get you
      or your friends infected. For curing purposes, "Trained" negates this effect,
      but for doing splicing and mutations, "Experienced" or "Professional" may be
      needed.
  - rscadd: The printout from the virus analyzer may have missing or erroneous information
      if you lack "Experienced" in virology. Quality of information improves with
      skill.
2018-06-23:

      the current + historic amount of reagent in the victim (ie, the total dose at
      one time) is more than 1u.
  - balance: Zombie death_breath now only creates 2u instead of 5u. This means a victim
      should usually take about 15 tox and have two 20% chances to be zombified if
      a single zombie breathes on them. Zombies can work together to push a victim
      over the 5u mark and instantly zombify them.
  - balance: Zombies cannot re-zombify themselves for a free rejuv.
  - tweak: observers cannot circumvent voting checks
  afterthought2:

  - rscadd: Weapons skill now has mechanical effects, hide yo children hide yo wife.

      to people. You can point and fire, but safety can be a bitch.

      an explicit toggle, can switch it with Ctrl-Click on the gun or with a rightclick

      of jamming, also let you perform better when in pain.

      do with random spawnpoints as everyone.
  - rscadd: Adds deployable SCG flags to Pathfinder lockers. They require Pathfinder
      access to pop up. Don't do anything, just fluff.

      underneath.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Piloting skill now has ingame effects.
  - rscadd: Taking Torch's helm without at least Trained skill can make Torch go not
      exactly where you want it to go. At Professional, passing meteor fields is less
      painful.
  - rscadd: Shuttles require different level of skill. Guppy is no-skill, Charon and
      Aquila need at least Basic. For purposes of skill, pilot is whoever tells it
      to move in console.

  - maptweak: Deck 1 - Xenoflora and Miscellaneous labs are now brighter. This should
      allow for scientists to actually see the things they work on. Robotics now has
      solid doors. Privacy windows are no longer thwarted by looking through the door-windows.
      Added a window to the mech bay side to compensate for the lack of visibility
      from that direction due to the door no longer having a window. Door to storage
      next to robotics actually opens for the roboticist now. Removed power cable

      are locked below basic, basic, and trained skill, resp. You will instead get
      some random data displayed. The programs do link to a terminal now.

      (expert+ for most things) you can run specific commands (type man for a list)
      to do rudimentary sysadmin diagnostic tasks. Notably, with network access, you
      can ssh into terminals of other computers over the network. If you are unskilled,
      you may get various failure effects or just be unable to do anything.
  - rscadd: To access the terminal, either use one of the programs or use Ctl Alt
      Click.

  afterthought2:
  - bugfix: Clonex should work properly with cryo tubes now (recall that you have
      to make it at -100 to -75 C, best done with the cooler). It will adjust its
      temperature to that of the cryo tube, which should prevent it from denaturing
      under normal circumstances.

      ready more eggs by feeding from mobs trapped in cocoons.
  - rscadd: The base variant of giant spider is now an unremarkable generic worker
      meant to fill the ranks. They don't have any special gimmicks. They're green.
  - rscadd: Added a proper guard caste to spiders. Guard spiders (brown) will now
      be paired with a nearby nurse (beige), and will closely follow them til' death
      do they part. Killing a nurse might throw their guard into a rage.
  - rscadd: Added a spitting spider (purple) caste - once they're out of venom, they'll

      and carp are currently the only ones set.
2018-12-10:
  Blue Bit:
  - rscadd: Liquids can now be collected from exoplanet puddles.
  - rscadd: Added tar. It's a bit toxic, but it can be heated and broken down.
  afterthought2:
  - rscadd: Some exoplanet plants now produce exotic chemicals, with effects that
      are randomly generated each round.
  - rscadd: Inspecting these chemicals in the mass spec with high chemistry and/or
      science skill will reveal additional information about them.
  - rscadd: By heating them to almost, but not quite, their boiling points, the effects
      of these chemicals strengthen (if with phoron catalysis, then weaken). By also
      adding certain additional ingredients (depending on the effect), the effect
      will instead be left unchanged.
  - rscadd: 'Cooling works similarly, but now the default behavior is that the effect
      is left unchanged: you need to add certain additional ingredients to make the
      effect strengthen (or weaken, with phoron).'
  - rscadd: These chemicals may have powerful combinations of medical (or poisonous)
      effects that can be used, or (if purified sufficiently) can be sold for large
      profits.

      have access: Captain, Research Director''s office, Research Director''s Petrov
      Office, SolGov Rep, and Corporate Liason.'
  - rscdel: Removed Genetics access from the game.
  - tweak: Renamed "Nanotrasen" in the access computer program to "Corporate".

2019-01-07:
  Anticept:
  - tweak: Radiation resistance now fully blocks radiation levels below its radiation
      resistance percentage, and thereafter will only allow some radiation leakthrough.
      Lower resistance suits leak much more readily once  past the threshold, while
      high resistance suits will only leak a little bit after the threshold is reached.
      Very highly irradiated environments are still extremely dangerous.
2019-01-08:
  Anticept:
  - tweak: The CE Firesuit is now firefighting rated, just like firesuits and atmos
      suits.
  Chinsky:
  - soundadd: Pain has a low chance of heartstop again. High shock levels ('You feel

      Countered by giving poor sod some painkillers to prevent shock, or some inapro
      to stabilize the pulse.
  sabiram:
  - maptweak: The Christmas tree in the bar has been removed.
2019-01-10:
  Anticept:
  - rscadd: Added a waste tank for atmospheric waste gasses next to the fuel bay.
      Now there's a place for gasses the Torch doesn't have a tank for, as well as
      storage for engine byproducts, and can be dumped to space or recovered with
      canisters. Also acts like a good way to clear a backed up atmos system if you
      know how to configure the pumps and valves, and don't mind spacing the gas.
  - rscdel: Engineering thrusters (not nacelles) are now purged from the game. They
      offered next to no thrust at all and now the engine room is a little bit simpler.
  - tweak: All black pipes in engineering ultimately go to the waste tank.

  lorwp:
  - tweak: IPCs can now use the Command Hardsuits
2019-01-11:

  - bugfix: ghosts and unconscious can no longer invoke the set transfer amount verb
      on containers and IVs.
  - tweak: Gas sensors in atmos and waste tank now display all gas contents that they
      can identify.
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Falling down zlevels now has a chance to dislocate feet/arms. Athletic
      skill mitigates it, Trained and above are safe.
  - tweak: Setting dislocated limbs now requires Medicine skill to be reliable, especially
      for self-setting. Basic skill is enough for ~90% success rate, Trained is guaranteed
      or your money back.
  - tweak: Walking on fractured or dislocated limbs now applies additional pain to
      that limb. Rest a bit for it to clear up or use a cane.
  Hubblenaut:
  - rscadd: Large escape pods will now repressurize themselves after undocking.
2019-01-21:
  Anticept:
  - rscadd: CMOs rejoice! Your hypospray now has a quantity setting, you can administer
      in 1,2,5,10,15,20, or 30 units per injection!
  - rscadd: CMOs rejoice! You can now pour your hypospray contents into a container
      without removing the vial! (you can already put reagents in it too without swapping
      vials)
  - rscadd: CMOs rejoice! You are now coordinated enough to swap vials on the fly.
      No longer do you have to remove and put away the old vial before you can install
      a new one.
  - rscadd: Medical rejoice! The contractor producing your syringes have heard your

  - rscadd: Adds a new exoplanet ruin, a data capsule ejected from a ship with zombie
      juice inside.
  Textor:
  - rscadd: Escape pod blast doors now open upon reaching pod launch sequence. You
      might want to stay out of maint areas near escape pods when pods are getting
      ready to launch.
  - maptweak: After much deliberation, the Health and Safety department decided that
      Engineering, the misc laboratory, and the tunnels outside the deck 2 escape
      pods should be more well-lit.

      or greater, regardless of what ship you are flying.
  - bugfix: Fixed phoron glass sheet's melting temperature so that reinforced phoron
      glass is consistent with the pre-material overhaul melting temperature. This
      should stop the random window breakage in the engine core until close to delamination
      temperatures.
  - tweak: Due to the nature of the material overhaul and this change, regular un-reinforced
      phoron glass also gets its temperature significantly buffed. It's still weak
      to physical attack by comparison to reinforced phoron glass.
  Cakey:
  - maptweak: Added LPA equipment closet to the Workplace Liason's office.
  - tweak: Added "Asset Protection Agent" as an alt title to LPA.

      or CO to authorize it. Yes it's pain, yes it's intended.
  - rscadd: It is only guaranteed to work with types of ammo it ships with - beanbags,
      flash, net rounds. Loading combat ammo voids warranty and may result in fun.
  Datraen:
  - rscadd: Adds Skrellian Weapons, currently admin spawn only.
  Herigony:
  - bugfix: Fixed admin jobban panel
  Textor:
  - bugfix: After paperwork being filled out in triplicate, lost, found, and buried

      considered officers and have an officer's uniform given to them when they wake
      up instead of an enlisted uniform.
  - rscadd: Labcoats can now be issued via the uniform vendor for EC science people.
  sabiram:

      now hopefully.
2019-02-07:
  comma:
  - tweak: The year is 2307 now. Roleplay accordingly.

  sabiram:
  - maptweak: The king of goats in the hydrobase planetary ruin has been retired.
2019-02-12:
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: CPR changes. It now will help with blood circulation even if it fails
      to restart the heart, so there's a reason to do it (especially on higher levels).
      Fake circulation lasts 20 seconds and is better with Anatomy/Medicine skill
      (highest).
  - rscadd: Can now put IV bags etc on rollerbeds and use them as IV stands for buckled
      people. Click with beaker to add it. Click with empty hand on empty (no buckled
      guy) bed to remove it. Drag bed on people to hook/unhook.
  - rscdel: Damaged livers no longer generate ammonia. It was creating self-perpetuating
      damage which wasn't intended, it was for diagnostic memes.
  - rscadd: Adds auto-CPR device. Goes into victim's suit slot. It won't do mouth-to-mouth
      or resusticate them, but it will help with circulation. Needs Basic Anatomy
      and Medicine skills to use, or risk rib fracture. Basically continuously applies
      circulation part of CPR. Mapped bunch of them in medbay
  - tweak: Sleepers now have 10x stasis option. Their power usage now also scales
      with stasis factor greatly, 500 per factor, so ~5000 W at 10x
  - rscadd: Guns suck now.
  - tweak: When you have a gun in activa hand, you're considered to be 'aiming'. Moving
      or changing active hand resets timer.
  - tweak: Aiming gives bonuses to accuracy, longer you aim, capped by accuracy of
      the gun - so no point in aiming longer than few secs with pistol, but with sniper
      rifle, take your time.
  - tweak: If you haven't stood still for at least a second, you get penalties based
      on size of your gun. Pistols are almost not affected, but rifles are affected
      greatly.
  - tweak: Accuracy falloff differs for different calibers. Pistol rounds are best
      used 4 tiles or closer, rifles can be used from any range without ok results.
      Lasers mirror that setup, with higher range.
  - tweak: Overall, pistols are now useless at range, but don't suffer much if you
      move around or change hand to do something else.
  - tweak: Rifles are oppsite, can hit if you aim even from other end of screen, but
      if you move around, you're not going to hit shit.
  - tweak: Moving around (not towards gun) will make you harder to hit now. Yakkety
      sax away.
  - rscadd: Added a small bells ringing sound playing when you regain consciousness.
      Will only play if player is considered AFK (currently 5 minutes without activity)

  Textor:
  - maptweak: The battery backup PSU in telecomms has been moved after many Chief
      Engineers and Senior Engineers have complained about its disruptive location.
      The battery backup PSU also now recharges off of the deck 3 subgrid rather than
      making a loopback off of the telecomms subgrid. Grey outlines have been moved
      around in telecomms to be more consistent with the rest of telecomms' appearance.
  - tweak: All telecomms machinery and computers have been updated to use NanoUI style
      interfaces, bringing them in line with the majority of UI interfaces on the
      Torch.
2019-02-15:
  Chinsky:
  - tweak: Accidental gun discharge chances upped, and now it can happen when aggressively
      unholstering (hurt intent). Chance is now 20% at unskilled, 5% at Basic and
      1% at Trained.
  - tweak: When unholstering or trying to fire a safetied gun on hurt intent, there's
      now a chance you automatically unsafety it. Chance is 0% at unskilled, 25% at
      Basic and 50% at Trained, guaranteed above.

  BlueNexus:
  - rscadd: Added Venaxilin, a powerful antivenom made with spider venom.
  - rscadd: Added leporazine variants, which are made by either heating up or cooling

  - maptweak: All the nacelles now have phoron windows installed on half-walls to
      conform with the aesthetic on the rest of the ship.
  - rscadd: After evaluating flaws in  evacuation procedures, all escape pod outer
      hatches now have a manual bolt override that can be manipulated with a wrench
      after opening the cover in the event that the power is offline. As a reminder,
      the outer hatch must be closed and the bolts re-engaged before the pod will
      launch.
  - tweak: Code Delta announcement no longer specifically mentions self destruct due
      to rare cases in which it is engaged without the destruct mechanism being online.

2019-03-08:
  SierraKomodo:
  - maptweak: Antag shuttles, merchant shuttle, and admin shuttles are now shielded
      against rad and ion storms.
2019-03-09:
  MistakeNot4892:
  - rscadd: Adamantine golem extracts now contain crystalizing agent.
  - rscadd: Crystalizing agent can be used to produce resin globules that work like
      medpacks for adherent and golems.
  - tweak: Golems can now be operated on by substituting a surgical drill for a scalpel,
      and resin packs for bone gel/fixovein/medpacks/cautery.
  - tweak: Vox are now capable of gaining nutrition from wood pulp, napalm, glue and
      various other inedible reagents.

      at all (those MUST NOT be exported!).
  afterthought2:
  - tweak: The IC printer can now take any materials as inputs.
  - bugfix: Circuits properly init their steel cost now; this means that some are

  - bugfix: Condiment containers can no longer be stored inside food.
2019-03-10:
  Anticept:
  - tweak: Atmos pumps have all had their power limits increased considerably. This
      means atmospherics will operate faster, but at the cost of much more power at
      peak performance. In addition, vents and scrubbers will operate faster when
      stressed, but they too will cause a tremendous power spike in a ship wide atmos
      contamination emergency where a huge number of scrubbers have to work hard (from
      a badly clogged waste line, for example). A flooded deck can also overload a
      deck substation, so bypass switching may be required in such cases. Beware of
      extreme scrubber overload!
  - tweak: Filter pressure limits raised to 15,000 kpa. They are still not powerful
      devices when pumping from low to high pressures. You should put pumps around
      them if you intend them to work quickly with moving pressures in a non-passive
      manner.
  FTangSteve:
  - maptweak: deck 2 hallway by janitorial now dimmer and with no cameras
  SierraKomodo:
  - bugfix: Medical is now restricted access again.
  SierraKomodo & Anticept:
  - tweak: Flight manifest input box no longer shows the rank to make it easier to
      find personel in the list. The report itself will show the rank.

      should be more consistent.
  sabiram:
  - tweak: Most castes of giant spider will generally do more damage, and may have
      more health.
2019-03-11:
  SierraKomodo:
  - tweak: You can no longer use headsets while sedated or sleepy-penned due to paralysis
      making you unable to use your hands.
  afirpo:
  - bugfix: now the Core Sampler (Xenoarcheologist and perhaps Anomalist related)
      works again - the sample is spitted out from its sample \ evidence bag.
  afterthought2:
  - rscadd: Adds the proxy command to terminals. This lets you obfuscate your nid
      by routing through another computer. Requires access_network and experienced
      skill. Generates local logs on the machine you route through, stored as a file
      on the hard drive.
2019-03-12:
  SierraKomodo:
  - maptweak: Added fire shutters to the cargo warehouse shutters
  Spookerton:
  - bugfix: Inappropriate crew and passengers no longer have supply program admin

      own shuttle (capable of overmap travel as well)
  Higgin:
  - tweak: Traitor TTVs now share power with merc TTVs.  They were underwhelming for
      40 TC cost.
  SierraKomodo:
  - bugfix: Windoors will now ignore walls when determining autoset access. This should
      fix hardsuit windoors.
  afterthought2:
  - tweak: Unathi brute mod for the subspecies has been decreased a lot.
  - tweak: Unathi healing can only be toggled once every two minutes. It cannot be
      toggled within a minute of being hit in combat.
  - tweak: Unathi limb and organ regeneration is only possible when the heal can be
      toggled.
  - tweak: When an unathi is at extreme levels of hunger, it no longer receives healing
      from the passive heal ability. Instead, it takes internal organ damage, converting
      it into nutrition. This is inefficient, so if the healing ability is left on,
      it will die quickly.
  - tweak: Unathi passive healing is less nutrition-efficient now.
2019-03-15:
  SierraKomodo:
  - tweak: Prone mobs can no longer buckle other mobs to beds/chairs. This prevents

2019-03-17:
  MistakeNot4892:
  - rscdel: The flying pizza sprites are no longer available to crew robot modules.
  - rscadd: A flying robot frame can now be constructed as an alternative to standard
      robot. It uses the same arms, chest and head as the regular robot, but needs
      the 'flyer' frame.
  - rscadd: Flying robot frames produce flying robots, which use the flying pizza
      sprites and can pass over tables. They have a selection of unique modules to
      pick from and are generally faster but more fragile.
2019-03-18:
  SierraKomodo:
  - bugfix: Chairs and stools now have the correct materials when constructed and
      deconstructed.

      material.

      you. The core defends itself the most vigorously.
  - tweak: Blobs now attack with a random damage type.
  - rscadd: You can now attempt to remove a sample from blobs by attacking it with
      wire cutters. The regular blobs produce fairly powerful weapons in various damage
      types, and the nuclei produce cores which can be disassembled for research points.
  - tweak: Cigarettes and the like can now be lit by more hot objects such as plasma
      cutters, and some tendrils snipped from the blob.
2019-03-24:
  Spookerton:
  - bugfix: Robot organs in meat bodies can be repaired with nanopaste in surgery.

      that handle up to 12,000K.
  - maptweak: Adds a temperature/gas sensor to the burn chamber.
  - maptweak: Vox ship ignition switch now isn't hidden under a light.

      has master level IT skill.
  - tweak: The NTNet Quantum Relay in telecomms will now keep physical logs of network
      activity, wiping the NTNet Diagnostics Program logs will not affect these, and
      they cannot be accessed remotely. The portable drive can be removed via a UI
      eject button and the data imported from it into a modular computer.
  - maptweak: Telecomms storage room now has a couple of spare portable hard disks.

  afterthought2:
  - tweak: The shield generator has been reworked. It is now much more expensive to
      keep the shields on continuously, and for large shields it's likely not viable.
  - rscadd: The shield generator now has an idle and active state (as well as the
      off state). In the idle state, it consumes limited power and does not generate
      a shield. In the active state, it consumes a lot of power and produces a shield.
  - rscadd: If an idle generator is toggled on, it takes a short amount of time to
      spin up to active state. If an active generator is toggled to idle, it will
      switch to that state instantly.
  - rscadd: There are several levels of idle power usage that can be selected. Higher
      power usage decreases the spin-up time proportionately.

      damage, and shock mode replaced by a mode that scatters low damage pellets in
      a burst.
  - rscadd: Adds sonic cannon. A vox stun rifle, with a mode that uses up all the
      gun's charge to push, deafen, and dizzy an opponent. Ear protection such as
      helmets and earmuffs will negate the deafening, and reduce the dizziness.
  - rscadd: Added the associated projectile types for both above, obviously.
  - rscadd: Added two new firing sounds, spike.ogg and eLuger.ogg

      give you 1 in that tech.
  - rscdel: Removes Arcane Tech, as it did nothing.

      with parts segmented by automatic shutoff valves to prevent leakage. The fuel
      lines has also been removed completed from the SM heating element (although
      the HE pipes are still there) and they should now be able to survive an SM delamination.
      To balance out these safety features, fuel line pressure has been doubled to
      increase the risk of bodily harm.
  mikomyazaki:
  - bugfix: Glasses that apply a vision overlay (mesons, tactical goggles, etc.) will
      no longer function when you are using a sensor console to view the overmap.
2019-08-19:

      chopping instead of sampling.
  - tweak: Can alt-click vines when holding normal-sized blade (machet) in hand to
      chop them down. It'll take a short time, faster if you have Trained botany skill.
