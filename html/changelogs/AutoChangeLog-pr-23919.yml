  - balance: "Handheld and mounted/portable flashers now work on all simple animals."

  - balance: "Various spider numbers tweaks. Reduced hunter maximum damage. Reduced lifesteal for all castes. Reduced nurse venom-ness."
  - balance: "Nurse spiders now have a maximum amount of eggs they can lay. They can ready more eggs by feeding from mobs trapped in cocoons."
  - rscadd: "The base variant of giant spider is now an unremarkable generic worker meant to fill the ranks. They don't have any special gimmicks. They're green."
  - rscadd: "Added a proper guard caste to spiders. Guard spiders (brown) will now be paired with a nearby nurse (beige), and will closely follow them til' death do they part. Killing a nurse might throw their guard into a rage."
  - rscadd: "Added a spitting spider (purple) caste - once they're out of venom, they'll have to generate more before they can spit again. They'll resort to melee combat if they're out of spitting venom."
  - rscadd: "Hunter spiders can now initiate combat by leaping at their prey."
  - tweak: "Hostile mobs will now only attempt to destroy their environment if the obstacle is between them and their target."
  - tweak: "Hostile mobs now have a chance to miss their attacks. Flashing them increases the chance."
  - tweak: "Hostile mobs can now have individual delays for prying open doors. Spiders and carp are currently the only ones set."
