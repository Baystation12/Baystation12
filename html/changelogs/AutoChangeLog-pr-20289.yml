  - rscadd: "Adds the ability to 'crawl' to an adjacent turf by click-dragging yourself to it, after a delay. This can be used to move while unable to stand. You can also do this with other movable objects, if you really wanted to."
  - tweak: "Conscious mobs lying on the ground can now buckle themselves to chairs/beds. This includes people missing legs."
