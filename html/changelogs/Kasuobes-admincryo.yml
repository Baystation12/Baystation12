# Optional: Remove this file after generating master changelog.  Useful for PR changelogs that won't get used again.
delete-after: True

# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added admin_cryo() as an admin proc for quickly disposing inactive characters. Note this does not replace the delete proc, but rather allow characters lying around in the hallway to be removed similarly to going into cryo without having to drop the mob into cryo manually. This works for all mobs, but please do not use it on pAIs and AIs as they have their own processes for ghosting."
