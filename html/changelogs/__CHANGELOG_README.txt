Changelogs are included with commits as text .yml files created individually by the committer. If you want to create a changelog entry you create a .yml file in the /changelogs directory; nothing else needs to be touched unless you are a maintainer.

TO MAKE A CHANGELOG .YML ENTRRY

1. Make a copy of the file example.yml in html/changelogs and rename it to [YOUR USERNAME]-PR-[YOUR PR NUMBER].yml or [YOUR USERNAME]-[YOUR BRANCH NAME]. Only the username is strictly required, anything else is organizational and can be ignored if you so wish.

2. Change the author to yourself

3. Replace the changes text with a description of the changes in your PR, keep the double quotes to avoid errors (your changelog can be written ICly or OOCly, it doesn't matter)

4. (Optional) set the change prefix (rscadd) to a different one listed above in example.yml (this affects what icon is used for your changelog entry)

5. When commiting make sure your .yml file is included in the commit (it will usually be unticked as an unversioned file)
