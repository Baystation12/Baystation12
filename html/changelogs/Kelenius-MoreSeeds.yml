# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - tweak: "Garden got most of their plants back. The only plants exclusive to xenobotany now are ambrosia (blame chinsky), kudzu (too dangerous), plastellium (useless), alien seeds, and randomly-generated ones."
  - tweak: "Seed storages now start with 30 of each seed type, not 2 or 3."
  - rscadd: "Xenobotany now starts with 30 of each type of alien seeds (previously only available from fossils) and 10 random seeds."
