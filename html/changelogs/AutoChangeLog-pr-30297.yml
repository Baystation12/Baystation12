changes:
  - tweak: Cultist pylons are now destroyed permanently when they shatter, instead
      of being placed into a weird "broken" state where have the exact same sprite
      but can be passed over.
  - tweak: Cult pylons now have a proper health system, instead of using random chance
      to determine if they're damaged.
  - tweak: Wraiths now float, preventing them from falling down z-levels and letting
      them counteract gravity. They'll still drift in space, though.
  - tweak: Artificer abilities no longer use a super loud sound.
  - bugfix: Finally fixed wraiths being unable to use their Phase Shift.
  - bugfix: Fixed player-controlled simple animals (like constructs) being unable
      to hurt things.
  - bugfix: Natural weapons can no longer embed into wounds.
  - bugfix: Artificers now correctly repair constructs on an attack instead of bashing
      them.
