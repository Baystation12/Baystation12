changes: 
  - tweak: "Ship movement physics have been altered. Ships are now generally slower to accelerate, though can move pretty fast when at max speed. This includes the Torch as well as overmap-capable shuttles and away site vessels."
  - bugfix: "Overmap wrapping when moving diagonally has been fixed."
  - tweak: "Shuttles no longer have gravity when not at a location that has ambient gravity."
  - rscadd: "A new admin tool has been added, Toggle Overmap Halt, which allows admins to make all overmap ships stop and freeze them from moving."
