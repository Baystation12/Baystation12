changes: 
  - tweak: "The Counselor is now mildly psionic, and is a registered affiliate of the Cuchulain Foundation for RP purposes. They have some tat in their office relating to psionics more generally. This is hopefully going to be a way to make psionics more broadly known ingame - see Discord/PR/other discussions if interested."
  - rscdel: "Removed Psychiatrist."
  - tweak: "Psychologist is now a Passenger alt title."
