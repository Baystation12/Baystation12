				<li class="tweak">Some other skills help with some steps, e.g. Trained Forensics offsets penalty for incisions, and Complex Devices skill is used instead for robotic organ steps, with Electrician and Construction helping with simple limb repair steps.</li>

The actual effects of poisonous gasses is determined by the reagent value (as per dexalin being injected into a vox, etc.).
