	<ul class="changes bgimages16">
		<li class="rscadd">The return of the Nanotrasen Scripting Language! (NTSL) If you haven't heard of NTSL, it is a scripting language within a game for telecomms. Yes, you can create scripts to interact with the radio! For more information, head here: http://wiki.nanotrasen.com/index.php?title=NT_Script But before you do, if you are not an antag, do not create bad scripts which hinders communication.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Cameras, mulebots and cyborgs can have signallers attached to their wires, like airlocks!</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Cameras have non-randomized wires and the power wire when pulsed will now toggle the camera on and off.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Cyborgs have a new wire, the lockdown wire! It will disable/enable the lockdown of a Cyborg when pulsed.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">The traffic control computer (or more commonly known as the computer which lets you add NTSL scripts) will now have a user log, which will log all user activity. Other users can then view that log and see who has been uploading naughty scripts!</li>
		<li class="rscadd">NTSL has two new functions! time() and timestamp(format) will help you increase the range of types of scripts you can make, especially time(); since you can then make the scripts know the different between each execution by storing the results in memory.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Two new advance disease symptoms! Their names are "Longevity" and "Anti-Bodies Metabolism". Have fun experimenting with them!</li>

	<ul class="changes bgimages16">
		<li class="rscadd">Simplified detective stuff. The high-res scanner is gone and instead the detective's normal scanner will instantly report all fingerprints, dna and cloth fibers in full. This was needed because the system took too long to work with and disencouraged detectives. Not only that, it made detectives less of a threat for antagonists and made possible scenerios, such as framing someone by changing fingerprints with someone else, impratical. To replace the computer, the detective will have a full medical computer with access to it. Not only that, but his useless filing cabinet will be replaced with an empty one for serious investigators. Along with this, are fingerprint cards and built-in PDA scanning, as all of security had access to it which was really the detective's thing. The new scanner will also log every finding and you can print them out as a report by clicking the scanner while it is in your active hand.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">You can toggle the pressure of your sprayer by clicking on it while it is in your active hand. With pressure, the sprayer will spray 10 units on the floor, otherwise it sprays 5. You'll need to turn pressure on to spray water on the floor and make it slippery.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">AIs in intellicards can no longer move their camera. This will limit them in ability but without making creating and carding an AI to have as a personel door opener impossible.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Telecommunication Busses can now be set to change the frequency of a signal. (Allowing you to say.. set the command channel to broadcast to the common channel).</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Telecommunication was changed to be more effecient. Because of this, Relays don't need a broadcaster or a receiver and you can setup a relay on it's own. You can still disable sending and or receiving from the relay's interface.</li>

		Lots of changes. This is just a brief summary of the most recent changes; still working on proper documentation.<br>
		All admins have access to view-vars, player-panel(for individual mobs), game panel and secrets panel. Most of the things on those pages have their own rights requirements. For instance, you can only use event orientated secrets in the secret panel if you have FUN rights. Debug secrets if you have DEBUG rights. etc.<br>
		Spawn xeno and toggle gravity procs were moved into the secrets panel (fun).<br>
		<a href='http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/source/browse/trunk/config/admin_ranks.txt'>This</a> may help with understanding which flags do what. Unfortuanately it's still somewhat vague.<br>
		If you have any problems, feel free to PM me at irc.rizon.net #coderbus. I go by the username carn or carnie.

		<li class="rscadd">-Changes flour from an item to a container-held reagent. All recipes have been updated to use 5 units of reagent flour for every item required previously.   This has a few advantages: The 16(!) sacks of flour previously in the kitchen cabinet have been condensed to an equivalent 3 sacks. Beer is now brewable with universal enzyme, and converting lots of wheat into flour should be less tedious. Also, flour grenades, etc.  Because of this, flour is now obtained from the all-in-one blender rather than the processor, and spaghetti noodles are made with 5 units of flour in the microwave.</li>

The construction and deconstruction for them has also changed, so look it up or experiment it with yourself to see how to setup the cameras now. Cameras also get wires, like airlocks and APCs.

		<li class="rscadd">pAI gets a better PDA that can actually receive messages from people. They can also instantly reply like everybody else now and they can toggle their receiver/signaller/ringer.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">You can show the AI the notes on your PDA by holding it up to a camera. When you show up a paper/pda to the camera the AI can now click on your name to go to you, if you're near a camera. People who are Unknown will not have a link; which would've allowed the AI to track them.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Made the" common server" and the "preset right receiver" listen for frequencies 144.1 to 148.9. This will allow people to use different frequencies to talk to eachother without bothering the common channel. It will also allow Revs and Cultists to work with each other; everything is still logged though so it still has risks.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Increased the maximum frequency limit for handheld radios and intercoms. It will give you the option to just use station bounced radios on a higher frequency so that anyone with a headset can't simply tune in.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Created an All-In-One Grinder that is suppose to replace the blender, juicer and reagent grinder all together. Meaning any department that has a juicer, blender and grinder will instead get this. It will help people be more independent from Chemistry by recycling foods and plants.</li>

		<li class="wip">I'm currently working on cleaning up and moving around a large portion of the mob code. These changes do not directly affect players; HOWEVER, bugs, oversights or simple mistakes may cause problems for players. While I have tested as much as I can, there may be some lingering bugs I have missed. <p> This part of the mob code cleanup mainly focuses on damage variables and procs. So if you suspect something related to taking, dealing or examining damage is not working as intended please fill out an issue report <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/issues/list">here</a> and be as detailed as possible. This includes what you were doing, steps to reproduce the problem, who you were doing it to, what you were using ect... Thank you.</li>

		<li class="rscadd">Alien hunters will now cloak when using the 'stalk' movement intent. Whilst cloaked they will use up their plasma reserves. They can however cloak as long as they like. Using the Lay-down verb will allow them to remain cloaked without depleting their plasma reserves,  hence allowing them to lay ambushes for unsuspecting prey. Should a hunter attack anybody, or get knocked down in any way,  they will become visible. Hopefully this allows for more strategic/stealthy gameplay from aliens. On the other hand, I may have totally  screwed the balance so feedback/other-ideas are welcome.</li>

		<li class="wip"><font color="purple"><b>Massive Mob-Icon Overhaul:</b><br>A large amount of the mob code has been replaced. The systems replaced were causing immense performance issues so the following are very necessary optimisations.<br>However, there is a downside: SS13 code is the equivilant of monkeys on typewriters. Despite weeks of constant coding/testing there -will- be things I've missed. The kinds of bugs I'm expecting are overlays not updating and/or in rare cases things not appearing in your hud. Most of these issues can be worked around simply by dropping the item and picking it back up. If all else fails ask an admin to regenerate your icons through view-vars.<br><u>Please</u> report any bugs to me on <b>#coderbus IRC</b> or <b>make an issue on the tracker</b> as a matter of urgency. I will fix them ASAP.<br>Also a massive thankyou to Nodrak, Erro, Pete and Willox. :)</font></li>

		<li class="rscdel">Reverted dismemberment, the recent gun changes, and Tarajans. Before you shit up the forums, read this:</li>
		<li>Dismemberment was ported from Bay12, but only halfway, and there were several problems with it. I know many people really liked it, but as it stood it did not fit the playstyle here at all. This <b>had</b> to be removed, there is work on a more fitting system, but this had to be taken out first regardless, and the longer people beat around the bush the worse the situation got.</li>
		<li>The gun change was made for no real reason and was pretty problematic, so reverting that should mean there are a lot less 'accidental suicides.'</li>
		<li>Tarjans were reverted by request as well, and since keeping them working after removing dismemberment would be a stupid amount of work.</li>

                <BR><BR>How they get on-board: The quartermaster can now set the receiver frequency of his supplycomp circuit board. A bit simplistic as of now, will work on it later. Building a supplycomp with a properly set up circuitboard will give access to the Contraband crate.
                <BR><BR>How they're used: Unfold the rolled poster on any wall or r_wall to create the poster. There are currently 17 designs, with the possibility of me adding more.
                <BR><BR>How to get rid of them: You can rip them using your hand... To cleanly extract them and not ruin them for future use, however, you can use a pair of wirecutters.
                <BR><BR>How they're classified: They're contraband, so it's perfectly okay for security officers to confiscate them. Punishment for contraband-providers (or end-users, if you want to go full nazi) is up to the situational commanding officers.

		<li class="rscadd">Escape shuttles/pods now spend about 2 minutes in high-speed transit before they reach centcom/recon shuttle. <b><font color=red>This is a warning: regular after-round shuttle grief is NOT OKAY while the shuttle is still  in transit! Save it for when the shuttle gets to centcom!</b></font color> The purpose of this is to give potential antagonists and protagonists a chance to have a final showdown in the shuttle. The round does not end until the shutle comes to a stop and docks. Don't step outside while the shuttle is moving!<br><br>For example; if you are a traitor and have an escape-alone objective and a couple of people manage to squeeze in the shuttle, you have two minutes to kill/toss them out to win. Or you can just chill for the duration and reflect on the round.</li>
