				<li class="rscadd">The shield generator now has an idle and active state (as well as the off state). In the idle state, it consumes limited power and does not generate a shield. In the active state, it consumes a lot of power and produces a shield.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If an idle generator is toggled on, it takes a short amount of time to spin up to active state. If an active generator is toggled to idle, it will switch to that state instantly.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Radiation collectors will have variable fuel usage, capping out at 250Bq radiation. Fuel usage increased significantly (1-10x depending on radiation levels)</li>
				<li class="tweak">Radiation collectors will now break from high radiation levels (500Bq) as well as temperature, they will display a warning and play a warning sound.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Stowaways can no longer spawn in the incinerator room, which they cannot leave.</li>
