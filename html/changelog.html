			<h3 class="author">Zuhayr updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Numerous new ores spawn on the asteroid. They can be compressed into bricks and ground up for reagents.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The ore processor has been rewritten and will happily eat anything containing metal or other substances, and can then fart them out as sheets.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Hacking without the electrical skill is harder now.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you are unskilled in electrical, hacking will randomize the wire positions (not meanings) each time you open the screen. If you are basic, you'll get some possible duplicate colors/omitted colors, with smaller probabilities.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you pulse a wire below trained skill, you have (progressively smaller) chances of pulsing the wrong wire. If you are untrained, you may randomize wire positions for everyone else trying to hack the thing.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you cut/mend wires below trained skill, you may cut/mend some extra wires by accident.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you try to place a remote signaler with low skill (trained or lower), you might place it on the wrong wire, and then have a hard time removing it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">A new "Examine" option has been added to the hacking menu. Below experienced it doesn't do much. On experienced one or two wires will be identifiable on examine, while at master most will be. Less effective for "secure" objects with randomized wiring.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">nearlyNon updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">

				<li class="rscadd">Cyborg integrated version of the above, using the borg's internal battery, and a failsafe on it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">IPCs and FBPs are now adversely affected by ion storms. They will be confused and have blurry vision as their system partially resets to remove ionospheric corruption. To avoid this, hide out in a saferoom or shuttle, or the dorms or such.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Prescription science goggles can now be selected from loadout.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Botany skill now has ingame effects.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Without at least basic skill, you can screw up when planting or weeding trays. You'll also be unable to recognize pests and weeds from useful things.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Exotic seeds (all random variations) need trained skill to avoid screw ups like that.</li>
