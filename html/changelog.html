				<li class="rscadd">A new "Examine" option has been added to the hacking menu. Below experienced it doesn't do much. On experienced one or two wires will be identifiable on examine, while at master most will be. Less effective for "secure" objects with randomized wiring.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Prescription science goggles can now be selected from loadout.</li>
