			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="maptweak">Non-general areas on Crescent are now protected by blast doors to enforce area restrictions. Admins can operate these from the central checkpoint.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">24 June 2015</h2>
			<h3 class="author">HarpyEagle updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Tajaran name generation producing names without a space between first and last.</li>
				<li class="wip">Adds docking to the mercenary shuttle. Works similarly to other shuttles, except docking and undocking is manually initiated and not automatic. A system to approve or deny dock requests still to be implemented.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Toolboxes can now hold larger items, such as stacks of metal or power cells, at the cost of having less space for other things.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Gloves/shoes can now be worn even if you have one hand/foot missing. The other one still has to be present, of course. The items still drop when you first lose the hand/foot.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Budget insulated gloves are somewhat less useless. On average, they will stop half the damage from getting shocked, and the worst case insulation is not as bad as it used to be. Budget gloves that are as good as regular insulated gloves are still as rare as they were before though.</li>
				<li class="tweak">PTR bullets are now hitscan, to make them somewhat better for actual sniping.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">The telecoms server room now has an actual cycling airlock into it.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Non-vital body parts will no longer take further damage above a certain amount, and will inflict paincrit effects instead. On most humaniods the head, chest, and groin are vital.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Engineers now spawn with industrial workboots (credit: ChessPiece/Bishop).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Damaged robotic legs now more likely to have an effect.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed bug preventing internal organs from taking damage in some cases.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">New flavours of tables around the station. Engineering starts with more plastic.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed worn items not appearing in some cases. Most notably crossbows and certain guns when worn on the back. As a side effect, laundry machines no longer transform items.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Crit oxyloss now runs in game time instead of real time. So if lag is slowing your movement the same slowdown applies to the dying person you're trying to reach.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Breathmasks can now be adjusted by clicking on them in your hand, in addition to the verb.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Wearing a space helmet or similar face-covering gear now prevents eating and force-feeding food, drink, and pills.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Phoron in air ignites above it's flashpoint temperature and a certain (very small) minimum concentration. Environments that have oxygen and are hot enough, and have phoron but not enough concentration to burn will produce flareouts, which are mostly a visual effect.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds animation when making unarmed attacks or attacking with melee weapons, to help make it clearer who is attacking.</li>
				<li class="soundadd">Opening an unpowered door now has an appropriate sound.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ingesting diseased blood may contract the disease.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">19 June 2015</h2>
			<h3 class="author">HarpyEagle updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">

				<li class="rscadd">Matches can now be used to light things adjacent to you when thrown.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Made the effects of having a damaged robotic leg more prominent.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Robot limbs no longer cause pain messages. A reminder that you can still check their status with 'Help Intent' -> 'Click Self'.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Knifing damage scales with weapon force and throat protection. Helmets only provide throat protection if they are air tight. Trying to cut someone's throat with wirecutters and/or while wearing an armoured sealed helmet will require several attempts before the victim passes out.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Knifing switches on harm intent, in case you just wanted to beat on the victim for some reason.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Prevents knifing bots or silicons.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">05 June 2015</h2>
			<h3 class="author">PsiOmegaDelta updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">

				<li class="tweak">Can no longer merge cables of different colors.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">04 June 2015</h2>

				<li class="rscadd">AI eyes can now be found in the observer follow list.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Synths can now review all law modules that can be found on the station from their law manager.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Synths can state these laws if desired, however this is strongly discouraged unless subverted/malfunctioning.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Astral projecting mobs, such as wizards or cultists, may no longer respawn as something else while their body lives.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">30 May 2015</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Atlantis updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Malfunction Overhaul - Whole gamemode was completely reworked from scratch. Most old abilities have been removed and quite a lot of new abilities was added. AI also has to hack APCs to unlock higher tier abilities faster, instead of having access to them from the round start. Most forced things, such as, shuttle recalling were removed and are instead controlled by the AI. Code is fully modular allowing for future modifications.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">HarpyEagle updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes Engineer ERT gloves not being insulated.</li>

			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">22 May 2015</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Ccomp5950 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Beepsky no longer kills goats.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Goats will move towards vines that are 4 spaces away now instead of 1</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Goats will eat the spawning plants for vines as well as the vines themselves.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Chinsky updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Ghetto diagnosis. Grab patient, aim at bodypart you want to check, click on them with help intent. This will tell you about their wounds, fractures and other oddities (toxins/oxygen) for that bodypart.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Fractures are visible on very damaged limbs. Dislocations are always visible. Surgery incisions now visible too.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Stethoscopes actually make sense now. They care for heart/lungs status when reporting pulse and respiration now.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Bear traps now do damage when stood on, enough to break bones! Bear traps can now affect any limb of a person who is on the ground, including head! Bear traps are no longer legcuffs and instead embed in the limb they attack.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Bear traps now take several seconds to deploy and cannot be picked up when armed, they must be disarmed by clicking on them. They also cannot be moved then they are deployed.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Zuhayr updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Massive material refactor. Walls, beds, chairs, stools, tables, ashtrays, knives, baseball bats, axes, simple doors, barricades, so on.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Tables are now built via steel then another sheet on the resulting frame. They can then be reinforced by dragging a stack of sheets onto the table.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Walls are built with steel for girders, then right-click the girder and select the reinforce verb while holding a stack, then click the girders with a final sheet.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Various things can be built with various sheet types. Experiment! Just keep in mind that uranium is now radioactive and phoron is now flammable.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Rewrote tables. To construct a table, use steel to make a table frame, then plate the frame with a material such as steel, gold, wood, etc. Hold a stack in your hand and drag it to the table to reinforce it. To deconstruct a table, use a screwdriver to remove the reinforcements (if present), then a wrench to remove the plating, and a wrench again to dismantle the frame. Use a welder to repair any damage.

				<li class="rscadd">Good news to the roboticists! The long waited firmware update for the bots has arrived. You can expect the following changes:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Medbots have improved the disease detection algorithms.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Floorbot firmware has been bugtested. In particular, they will no longer get stuck near the windows, hopelessly trying to fix the floor under the glass.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Floorbots have also received an internal low-power metal synthesizer. They will use it to make their own tiles. Slowly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Following the complains from humanitarian organizations regarding securitron brutality, stength of their stunners has been toned down. They will also politely demand that you get on the floor before arresting you. Except for the taser-mounted guys, they will still tase you down.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Other minor fixes.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The lasertag bots are now forbidden to build and use following the incident #1526672. Please don't let it happen again.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The farmbot design has been finished! Made from a watertank, robot arm, plant analyzer, bucket, minihoe and a proximity sensor, these small (not really) bots will be a useful companion to any gardener and/or xenobotanist.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Spider learning alert: they have learned to recognize the bots and will mercilessly attack them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">An experimental CPU upgrade would theoretically allow any of the bots to function with the same intelligence capacity as the maintenance drones. We still have no idea what causes it to boot up. Science!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">INCOMING TRANSMISSION: Greetings to agents, pirates, operatives, and anyone who otherwise uses our equipment. Following the NT update of bot firmware, we have updated the cryptographic sequencer's hacking routines as well. The medbots you emag will not poison you anymore, the clanbots won't clean after themselves immediately, and floorbots... wear a space suit. Oh, and it works on the new farmbots, too.</li>
