				<li class="bugfix">Fixed Tajaran name generation producing names without a space between first and last.</li>

Budget gloves that are as good as regular insulated gloves are still as rare as they were before though.</li>
				<li class="tweak">PTR bullets are now hitscan, to make them somewhat better for actual sniping.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">The telecoms server room now has an actual cycling airlock into it.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed worn items not appearing in some cases. Most notably crossbows and certain guns when worn on the back. As a side effect, laundry machines no longer transform items.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Crit oxyloss now runs in game time instead of real time. So if lag is slowing your movement the same slowdown applies to the dying person you're trying to reach.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Breathmasks can now be adjusted by clicking on them in your hand, in addition to the verb.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Wearing a space helmet or similar face-covering gear now prevents eating and force-feeding food, drink, and pills.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Phoron in air ignites above it's flashpoint temperature and a certain (very small) minimum concentration. Environments that have oxygen and are hot enough, and have phoron but not enough concentration to burn will produce flareouts, which are mostly a visual effect.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds animation when making unarmed attacks or attacking with melee weapons, to help make it clearer who is attacking.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Robot limbs no longer cause pain messages. A reminder that you can still check their status with 'Help Intent' -> 'Click Self'.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Knifing damage scales with weapon force and throat protection. Helmets only provide throat protection if they are air tight. Trying to cut someone's throat with wirecutters and/or while wearing an armoured sealed helmet will require several attempts before the victim passes out.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Knifing switches on harm intent, in case you just wanted to beat on the victim for some reason.</li>
