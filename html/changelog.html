			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">The flying pizza sprites are no longer available to crew robot modules.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">A flying robot frame can now be constructed as an alternative to standard robot. It uses the same arms, chest and head as the regular robot, but needs the 'flyer' frame.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Flying robot frames produce flying robots, which use the flying pizza sprites and can pass over tables. They have a selection of unique modules to pick from and are generally faster but more fragile.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Unathi brute mod for the subspecies has been decreased a lot.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Unathi limb and organ regeneration is only possible when the heal can be toggled.</li>
				<li class="tweak">When an unathi is at extreme levels of hunger, it no longer receives healing from the passive heal ability. Instead, it takes internal organ damage, converting it into nutrition. This is inefficient, so if the healing ability is left on, it will die quickly.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Unathi passive healing is less nutrition-efficient now.</li>

			<h2 class="date">10 March 2019</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Anticept updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Atmos pumps have all had their power limits increased considerably. This means atmospherics will operate faster, but at the cost of much more power at peak performance. In addition, vents and scrubbers will operate faster when stressed, but they too will cause a tremendous power spike in a ship wide atmos contamination emergency where a huge number of scrubbers have to work hard (from a badly clogged waste line, for example). A flooded deck can also overload a deck substation, so bypass switching may be required in such cases. Beware of extreme scrubber overload!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Filter pressure limits raised to 15,000 kpa. They are still not powerful devices when pumping from low to high pressures. You should put pumps around them if you intend them to work quickly with moving pressures in a non-passive manner.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">CPR changes. It now will help with blood circulation even if it fails to restart the heart, so there's a reason to do it (especially on higher levels). Fake circulation lasts 20 seconds and is better with Anatomy/Medicine skill (highest).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Can now put IV bags etc on rollerbeds and use them as IV stands for buckled people. Click with beaker to add it. Click with empty hand on empty (no buckled guy) bed to remove it. Drag bed on people to hook/unhook.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Adds auto-CPR device. Goes into victim's suit slot. It won't do mouth-to-mouth or resusticate them, but it will help with circulation. Needs Basic Anatomy and Medicine skills to use, or risk rib fracture. Basically continuously applies circulation part of CPR. Mapped bunch of them in medbay</li>
				<li class="tweak">Sleepers now have 10x stasis option. Their power usage now also scales with stasis factor greatly, 500 per factor, so ~5000 W at 10x</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Guns suck now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">When you have a gun in activa hand, you're considered to be 'aiming'. Moving or changing active hand resets timer.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Aiming gives bonuses to accuracy, longer you aim, capped by accuracy of the gun - so no point in aiming longer than few secs with pistol, but with sniper rifle, take your time.</li>
				<li class="tweak">If you haven't stood still for at least a second, you get penalties based on size of your gun. Pistols are almost not affected, but rifles are affected greatly.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Accuracy falloff differs for different calibers. Pistol rounds are best used 4 tiles or closer, rifles can be used from any range without ok results. Lasers mirror that setup, with higher range.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Overall, pistols are now useless at range, but don't suffer much if you move around or change hand to do something else.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Rifles are oppsite, can hit if you aim even from other end of screen, but if you move around, you're not going to hit shit.</li>
