<!-- NOTE TO UPDATERS!! Please only list things which are important to players. 
Stuff which is in development and not yet visible to players or just code related 
(ie. code improvements for expandability, etc.) should not be listed here. They 
should be listed in the changelog upon commit though. Thanks. -->

<!-- To take advantage of the pretty new format (well it was new when I wrote this anyway), open the "add-to-changelog.html" file in any browser and add the stuff and then generate the html code and paste it here -->

		<li class="experiment"><b>People in critical (less than -50 health) from external trauma (100+ damage from brute and/or burn) bleeding, and with unsplinted limbs, will send a message to anyone trying to drag them, to warn them it would be a bad idea trying to move them. They will suffer a lot more damage if dragged while lying down.<br>The correct procedure is therefore, A) Bring a roller bed, or B) Splint all limbs, stop all bleeding with gauze, and then drag them.</b></li>
		<li class="rscadd">Dragging someone while injured (brute) will have a small chance of injuring them further that increases depending on how damaged they are. This coincides with the blood spatters that are already generated.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Added splints that can be applied to broken arms and legs, and will reduce effects of broken limbs. These can be removed the same way as handcuffs. They show up on the mob and on examine.</li>

		<li class="rscadd"> Added an advanced medical kit that Medical Doctors spawn with that has Advanced Trauma Kits, Advanced Burn Kits, autoinjectors, and splints.</li>

		<li class="bugfix">ZAS now properly rebuilds zones, and connect/merge adjacent zones.  This should be the final real bugfix to the system.</li>
		<li class="wip">I have removed the aspects of the wound system causing the instant healing and, very likely, lag.  This will result in wounds healing instantly again, but the computational overhead being significantly less.</li>
