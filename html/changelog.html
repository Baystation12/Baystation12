				<li class="maptweak">Deck 1 - Xenoflora and Miscellaneous labs are now brighter. This should allow for scientists to actually see the things they work on. Robotics now has solid doors. Privacy windows are no longer thwarted by looking through the door-windows. Added a window to the mech bay side to compensate for the lack of visibility from that direction due to the door no longer having a window.

With enough skill (expert+ for most things) you can run specific commands (type man for a list) to do rudimentary sysadmin diagnostic tasks. Notably, with network access, you can ssh into terminals of other computers over the network. If you are unskilled, you may get various failure effects or just be unable to do anything.</li>
