<b><font color='blue'>7 November 2011</font><b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Kor updated:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Repair bots (mechs) are now adminspawn only</li>
    <li>Extra loyalty implants are now orderable via cargo bay (60 points for 4 implants)</li>
    <li>Changeling regen stasis now takes two full minutes to use, but can be used while dead. Burning and gibbing are the only way to keep them dead now.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<b><font color='blue'>29 October 2011</font><b>
<ul>
  <li><b>ConstantA updated:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Added step and turn sounds for mechs</li>
	<li>Added another mecha equipment - plasma converter. Works similar to portable generator. Uses solid plasma as fuel. Can be refueled either by clicking on it with plasma in hand, or directly from mecha - selecting it and clicking on plasma.</li>
	<li>Added mecha laser cannon.</li>
	<li>Added damage absorption for mechs. Different mechs have different absorption for different types of damage.</li>
	<li>Metal foam now blocks air movement.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Petethegoat updated:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed sticking C4 to containers.</li>
	<li>Rearranged the armoury, and changed the medical treatment room in Sec to an interrogation room.</li>
	<li>Mr Fixit has been powered off and returned to the armoury. Deploying him every round is still recommended!</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<b><font color='blue'>29 October 2011</font><b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Petethegoat updated:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Stunglove overhaul: part one. Stun gloves are now made by wiring a pair of gloves, and then attaching a battery- this shows up on the object sprite, but not on your character. Stungloves use 2500 charge per stun! This means that some low capacity batteries will make <i>useless</i> stungloves. To get your old inconspicous gloves back, simply cut away the wire and battery. <font color='red'>Note that insulated gloves lose their insulation when you wire them up!</font> <b>Yet to come:</b> stungloves taking extra damage from shocked doors.</li>
	<li><font color='red'>Removed sleepypens!</font> Paralysis pens have been changed to look like normal pens instead of penlights, and have been slightly nerfed. They will paralyse for about fifteen seconds, and cause minor brain damage and dizziness.
	<li>Uplink Implants now have five telecrystals instead of four.
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Doohl updated:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>More hairs added and a very long beard.</li>
    <li>Finally fixed the request console announcements going <b><font color = red>AMP AMP AMP</font color></b> all the time when you use punctuation.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<b><font color='blue'>27 October 2011</font><b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Mport updated:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>New WIP TK system added.  To activate your TK click the throw button with an empty hand.  This will bring up a tkgrab item.  Click on a non-anchored (currently) non mob Object to select it as your "focus".  Once a focus is selected so long as you are in range of the focus you can now click somewhere to throw the focus at the target.  To quit using TK just drop the tkgrab item.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<b><font color='blue'>21 October 2011, Tuesday:</font><b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Errorage updated:</b>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="red">Old keyboard hotkey layout option available again!</font> home, end, page down and page up now once again do what they did before by default. To use diagonal movement you will need to use your numpad with NUM LOCK enabled.<br>
		The new list of hotkeys is as follows: (Valid as of 21.10.2011)
		<ul>
			<li>Numpad with Num Lock enabled = movement in wanted direction.</li>
			<li>Numpad with Num Lock disabled = as it was before. movement north-south-east-west and throw, drop, swap hands, use item on itself.</li>
			<li>Page up (also numpad 9 with num lock disabled) = swap hands</li>
			<li>Page down (also numpad 3 with num lock disabled) = use item in hand on itself</li>
			<li>home (also numpad 7 with num lock disabled) = drop</li>
			<li>end (also numpad 1 with num lock disabled) = throw</li>
			<li>CTRL + A = throw</li>
			<li>CTRL + S = swap hands</li>
			<li>CTRL + D = drop</li>
			<li>CTRL + W = use item in hand on itself</li>
			<li>Numpad divide (/) = throw</li>
			<li>Numpad multiply (*) = swap hands</li>
			<li>Numpad subtract (-) = drop</li>
			<li>Numpad add (+) = use item in hand on itself</li>
		</ul>
		In short, use <font color='red'>Num Lock</font> to swap between the two layouts.
	</li>
  </ul>
  </li>

<b><font color='blue'>18 October 2011, Tuesday:</font><b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Errorage updated:</b>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="red">You can now move diagonally!</font> To do so, use the numpad. The keybaord has been remapped to make this possible:
		<ul>
			<li>CTRL + A = throw</li>
			<li>CTRL + S = swap hands</li>
			<li>CTRL + D = drop</li>
			<li>CTRL + W = use item in hand on itself</li>

  <li><b>Agouri updated:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>There has been a tidal wave of bugfixes over the last 5 or so days. If you had previously tried something on the station, saw that it was bugged and never tried it again, chances are it got fixed.

  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Errorage updated:</b>

  <ul>
    <li>Pandemic recharge speed is affected by the number of different types of antibodies in the blood sample. For maximum efficiency, use blood samples with only a single type of antibody.

		<li>A sneaky yordle can also hide in it, if he so desires, or hack it, or lock it or do a plethora of shady stuff with it. Beware, though, there's plenty of dangerous things you can do with it, both to you and your target.</li>
		<li>The Unit's control panel can be accessed by screwdriving it. That's all I'm willing to say, I'd like to let the players find out what each hack option does and doesn't. Will add more stuff later.</li>
		<li>Added Command Space suit, Chief Engineer space suit and Chief Medical Officer spacesuit (In a new space that you'll probably notice by yourself) to make it easier for you to look like a special snowflake.</li>
		<li>EVA and CMO office modified to accomodate the new suits and SSUs. Look, I'm not a competent mapper, okay? Fuck you too. A mapper is strongly recommended to rearrange my half assed shit.</li>
		<li>Soda cans, cigarette packets, cigarettes and cigars as well as bullet casings are now considered trash and can be picked up by the trashbag. Now you can annoy the janitor even more!</li>

		<li><b>New rune!</b> Stun rune. When used as rune, briefly stuns everyone around (including cultists). When imbued into a talisman, hit someone to stun and briefly mute them. Spawnable with the starter talisman.</li>

		<li>Beginning of armor overhaul. Armor now has slightly better defence against melee, and weaker against shots. More coming soon...someday</li>
		<li>Cyborgs finally drop their MMI when gibbed like they were supposed to back when I added MMIs. Round- start cyborgs use whatever name you have selected for your character for the brain that gets spawned for them.</li>

	</li>

	<li><b>Darem updated:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Chemistry update</li>
		<li>In containers where there isn't a perfect ratio of reagents, reactions won't consume ALL of the related reagents (so if you mix 10 anti-toxin with 20 inaprovaline, you get 10 tricordrazine and 10 inaprovaline rather then just 10 tricodrazine)</li>
		<li><font color='red'>Catalysts</font color>: some reactions might need presence of an element, while not directly consuming it.</li>
		<li>Reactions changed to use catalysts: all recipes that require Universal Enzyme now require 5 units of the enzyme but the enzyme isn't consumed (So Tofu, Cheese, Moonshine, Wine, Vodka, and Kahlua recipes).

	<li><b>Errorage updated:</b>

	<li><b><font color='red'>DANGERCON UPDATE:</font color><font color='blue'>Agouri and Erro updated(I'm in the DangerCon team now, nyoro~n :3):</font color></b>
	<ul>
		<li>Backpacks removed from all players. It was unrealistic. You can now had to the living quarters to get one from the personal closets there.</li>
		<li>Any firearms now send you to critical in 1-2 shots. Doctors need to get the wounded man to surgery to provide good treatment. Guide for bullet removal is up on the wiki.</li>
		<li>Brute packs and kelotane removed altogether to encourage use of surgery for heavy injury.</li>
		<li>Just kidding</li>
		<li>Fireaxe cabinets and Extinguisher wall-mounted closets now added around the station, thank Nanotransen for that.</li>
		<li>Because of Nanotransen being Nanotransen, the fire cabinets are electrically operated. AIs can lock them and you can hack them if you want the precious axe inside and it's locked. The axe itself uses an experimental two-handed system, so while it's <u><font color='red'>FUCKING ROBUST</u></font color> you need to wield it to fully unlock its capabilities. Pick up axe and click it in your hand to wield it, click it again or drop to unwield and carry it.You can also use it as a crowbar for cranking doors and firedoors open when wielded, utilising the lever on the back of the blade. And I didn't lie to you. It's fucking robust.</li>
		<li>Fireaxe, when wielded, fully takes up your other hand as well. You can't switch hands and the fireaxe itself is unwieldy and won't fit anywhere. 
		<li>A fireaxe cabinet can also be smashed if you've got a strong enough object in your hand.<li>
		<li><b>EXTINGUISHER CLOSETS</b>, made by dear Erro, can be found in abundance around the station. Click once to open them, again to retrieve the extinguisher, attack with extinguisher to place it back. Limited uses, but we've got plans for our little friend.
		<li><font color ='blue'><u>Sprite kudos go to: Cheridan for most of them, Khodoque for the fantastic fireaxe head. I merged those two. Also thanks to matty and Arcalane for giving it a shot.</font color></u></li>
		<li><font size = '2'><i>Has the piano got TOO annoying? Try the fire axe...</font size></i></li>
		<li>Oh, and tou can now construct Light floors! To do it: Use wires on glass, then metal on the produced assembly, then place it on an uncovered floor like you would when replacing broken floor tiles. To deconstruct: Crowbar on light floor, use crowbar on produced assembly to remove metal, wirecutters to seperate the wires from the glass. Sprites by delicious <font color ='blue'>Hempuli.</font color></li>
		<li>Got something to bitch about? Got a bug to report? Want to create drama? Did the clown destroy your piano while you were playing an amazing space remix of the moonlight sonata? Give it <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/source/detail?r=1543">here</a>

	<LI>Jesus christ it's a new map what the fuck
	<LI>Just kidding, it's only minor changes to medbay/mechbay/cybernetics/R&D/toxins/robotics/chapel/theatre
	<LI>Okay so there's too many changes to list completely, but basically: toxins/R&D/virology/xenobiology are south <i>through</i> medbay; robotics/cybernetics/mechbay are where toxins used to be, the theatre and chapel are above medbay.
	<LI>Theatre is a new place for the Clown and Mime to play, there are some costumes available, a stage and backstage, and seating for the audience.
	<LI>R&D and Toxins have been combined together. R&D is still work in progress. You need to head south through medbay to get there.
	<LI>Medbay has been re-arranged slightly. Honestly, it's nothing, I bet you won't even notice anything different. There's also a new surgery suite, complete with pre-op and post-op rooms. 
	<LI>Virology's been rearranged, but it is mostly in the same place still.
	<LI>Xenobiology is work in progress. [There's some fun stuff still being coded]
	<LI>The Chapel is now to the north. You'll probably be thinking something like "Goddamn, this place is fucking huge", but it's actually smaller than the previous chapel.
	<LI>Robotics and related stuff is also work in progress - however, everything needed for making borgs is there. Note: de-braining will now be done by surgeons in medbay, rather than roboticists in robotics, in case you're wondering where your optable went.
	<LI>I added color-coded pipes in the areas I was working on. Red pipes run from air siphons and feed into the waste loop; blue pipes run from air vents and pump whatever atmos is set to pump. Yeah, there's TWO pipe networks on the station, who knew? Well, some of you probably did, but I didn't!

	<LI>Ion storm laws should be much more interesting.
	<LI>Security reports should no longer list traitor heads/AIs as possible revs/cultists, nor should nuke operatives ever get named for anything.
	<LI>Pens are much more versatile and user friendly.
	<LI>Mech building is rapidly on its way! Ripleys can be built, consult your quartermasters.
	<LI>Traitors now have several new things they can steal.
	<LI>Some surgeries coded to accompany the new operating room and surgery tools.
	<LI>Research and Design is continuing development and should be rolled out shortly.
	<LI>Various sprites added, tweaked, scrapped and fixed.

<h5>14.01.2011, r853</h5>
<ul>
	<LI>Changlings Overhauled. Now function kinda like alium (using an internal chemical reserve instead of plasma) with each ability requiring a certain amount of chemicals to activate. Both venoms removed. Several "Dart" abiliites added. They allow the changling to deafen, blind, mute, paralyze, or even transform (dead) targets.
	<LI>Carp meat now contaminated with Carpotoxin. Anti-toxin negates the poison, however.

	<LI>Carded AIs no longer take damage while in unpowered areas.
	<LI>Chaplains can now name their religion at round start.
	<LI>New Recipies: Clown Burger (1 Clown wig, 5 flour), Mime Burger (1 beret, 5 flour), Cuban Carp (1 carp fillet, 1 chili, 5 flour).
	<LI>Napalm nerfed a bit. Produces ~25% less plasma but it's all concentrated in a single tile (will still spread, though).
	<LI>Reagent bottles can, once again, be put into grenades.
	<LI>Various minor map changes.
</ul>

<h5>08.01.2011,8:00PST, r820</h5>

	<LI>Pre-spawned pills no longer have randomized image.
	<LI>Bridge reorganized.

	<LI>Meat Crate added to QM.
	<LI>Corn can now be blended in a blender to produce corn oil which is used to create glycern.
	<LI>Request Consoles added across the station. Can be used to request things from departments (and slightly easier to notice then the radio).
	<LI>Centcom reoragnized a fair bit. Not that players care but admins might enjoy it.
	<LI>There is now a toggable verb that changes whether you'll turn into an alium or not.
	<LI>Hair sprited modified.
	<LI>Napalm and Incendiary Grenades both work now. Have fun setting things on fire.
	<LI>Binary Translater traitor item added. It allows traitors to hear the AI (it functions like a headset).
	<LI>New Disease: Pierrot's Throat. Enjoy, HONK!
	<LI>Robotic Transformation (from Robrugers) and Xenomorph Transformation (from xenoburgers) now curable.
	<LI>Mining added. Only accessible by admins (and those sent by admins). Very much WIP.
	<LI>Alium Overhaul. Divided into multiple castes with distinct abilities.
	<LI>New AI Modules: The goody two-shoes P.A.L.A.D.I.N. module and it's evil twin T.Y.R.A.N.T. Only the former actually spawns on the station.
	<LI>Lizards added. They run away and shit.
	<LI>PDA overhaul. Doesn't change anything for humans, just makes coders happy.
	<LI>Firesuits redone to look less like pajamas and instead like firesuits. Fire lockers also added.

	<LI>Circuit Imprinter: Using disks from the various deparments, new circuit boards and AI modules can be produced.
	<LI>Heat Exchanging pipes added and various pipe/atmos changes.
	<LI>Ghost/Observer teleport now works 100% of the time.

<h5>17.12.2010,11:00GMT</h5>
<ul>
	<LI>You need an agressive grip to table now, as well as being within one tile of the table (to nerf teletabling).</li>
	<LI>Teleport only runs once at the beginning of the round, hopefully reducing the lag in wizard rounds.</li>
	<LI>Wizards can't telepot back to their shuttle to afk now.</li>
	<LI>Someone added it a while ago and forgot to update the changelog - syndies in nuke need to move their shuttle to the station's zlevel first.</li>
	<li>Bunch of other stuff.</li>
