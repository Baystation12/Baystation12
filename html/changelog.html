			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Close Combat now has ingame effects. Mostly chances to hit in melee.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Disarm chances now both affected by skills and anything tha affects melee accuracy (being blind, being confused, blurry eyes, being in pain etc).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Most fancy grab moves (jointlocks, dislocations, tendons cutting) were locked away behind Trained skill in CQC.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">20 June 2018</h2>
			<h3 class="author">BlueNexus updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="balance">Railguns have been rebalanced to fill the niche of an anti-armour or sniper type role.</li>
				<li class="balance">All railguns now suffer a substantial penalty when fired one-handed.</li>
				<li class="balance">The basic railgun projectile no longer stuns, and does less damage.</li>
				<li class="balance">All railguns which accept steel rods as ammunition now use the basic projectile.</li>
				<li class="balance">The TCC railgun's (available in the traitor menu) ammo capacity has been reduced from 10 to 6.</li>

			<h3 class="author">Chinsky updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">EVA skill now has mechanical effects.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Space slipping chance is affected by EVA skill. Bit higher at unskilled, lesser with skill, no slipping at experienced.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Flooring when entering gravity from space is now not guaranteed at Basic skill or more. Doesn't happen at Professional skill.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">At Unskilled and Basic skill, jetpack can sometimes go wrong way. Not that bad if you notice in time and have fuel to turn back.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">At Professional skill you go faster when in space with a jetpack. Zooom.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Skills now affect surgery. Trained or Experienced (depending on what you're trying to do) skill is needed to ensure step won't fail. Professional skill will offset various penalties (not proper optable, improvised tools etc) a bit. Time of step is affected by Anatomy skill too.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Some other skills help with some steps, e.g. Trained Forensics offsets penalty for incisions, and Complex Devices skill is used instead for robotic organ steps, with Electrician and Construction helping with simple limb repair steps.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Optimization pass on Geiger counters, and a few effect systems (Smoke and sparks)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Underwear may now go into washing machines. Still can't be bloodied, but at least you can do that now. For you weird people who roleplay showering!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Rags may now clean more than just blood. More importantly, they show their progress bar when cleaning.</li>

			<h3 class="author">afterthought2 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">The chem grinder is dangerous to use at "Unskilled" in Chemistry and will lose some ingredients depending on skill level.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The chem dispenser will give inaccurate amounts of ingredients or add extra contaminating ingredients when below skill "Trained" (in Chemistry or Cooking, depending on dispenser)  Can be slightly dangerous.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The chem master now has two modes. "Quick" will move the correct amount of ingredients from beaker to buffer, but also add contaminants (depending on skill). "Thorough" will only move the desired ingredient, but incur losses (depending on skill). Skill checked is Chemistry for chem master, Cooking for Condimaster.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Moving ingredients from buffer to waste or beaker acts like on "Quick" mode.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">14 June 2018</h2>

			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">13 June 2018</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Cakey updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="imageadd">New wall sprites have been added.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">New door sprites have been added.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">New window sprites have been added.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">New grille sprites have been added.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Airlocks are now paintable.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Window frames have been added, which connect to walls for that aesthetic look.</li>

			<h3 class="author">ZeroBits updated:</h3>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Zuhayr updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Gas inhalation effects are now reagent-based. Gases create reagents inside the body, which then apply effects. This means that gaseous phoron exposure, for example, needs to be treated with dialysis/dylovene, as it fills your guts up with liquid phoron.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The poison_type var on species datums is now poison_types, and determines which poison gasses show you the toxins UI indicator, rather than which ones cause poisoning. The actual effects of poisonous gasses is determined by the reagent value (as per dexalin being injected into a vox, etc.). This really shouldn't impact anything for the average player, except that chlorine and nitrogen dioxide (not N2O, for clarity) are now actually poisonous.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Helium now makes your voice squeaky. Very important feature.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xenon is now functionally the same as N2O, including the following note.</li>
				<li class="tweak">N2O now causes giggling, confusion, dizziness and occasional passing out at high dosages, rather than instant and immediate knockout. Still useful for riot control and now flooding it into distro isn't a round-ender. You might even be able to use it without admins shouting at you! Refer to the optable neural suppressor PR for a replacement method to sedate people for surgery.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Finally, as a sidenote, Bogani will actually be poisoned by oxygen and chlorine will have a visible overlay now.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">afterthought2 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Experienced in Chemistry allows you to see scannable reagents in a held beaker/container.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Professional in Chemistry allows you to see all reagents in a held container.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Science goggles give more precise volume readings at higher chem skill.</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">afterthought2 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Lactate is a reagent that increases heart rate, causes generally harmless shortness of breath, and slows movement. After processing a large amount of lactate, mobs may experience temporary jitters.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Instead of producing adrenaline, pulling produces lactate.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Robots can now interact with storage items like boxes and bags.</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">afterthought2 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Throwing "huge" items (e.g. roller beds, backpacks, certain guns, rigs, jetpacks) or normal sized mobs without "Basic" skill in "Athletics" will briefly weaken you (and the items won't go far).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Thrown items don't go as far and have less speed/force if you have lower "Athletics" skill.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The weightlifting machine at the gym has more weight levels. Having high "Athletics" means you can lift more. If you try lifting way more than you are capable of, you may hurt yourself.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Bigger/stronger species pull things faster.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Pulling stuff generates adrenaline, depending on "Athletics" skill. This may raise your heart rate. Pulling for a long time without breaks with low skill may give you the jitter effect and minor heart damage (won't kill you).</li>
