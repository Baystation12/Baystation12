				<li class="maptweak">The battery backup PSU in telecomms has been moved after many Chief Engineers and Senior Engineers have complained about its disruptive location. The battery backup PSU also now recharges off of the deck 3 subgrid rather than making a loopback off of the telecomms subgrid. Grey outlines have been moved around in telecomms to be more consistent with the rest of telecomms' appearance.</li>
				<li class="tweak">All telecomms machinery and computers have been updated to use NanoUI style interfaces, bringing them in line with the majority of UI interfaces on the Torch.</li>

			<h2 class="date">12 February 2019</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Chinsky updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">CPR changes. It now will help with blood circulation even if it fails to restart the heart, so there's a reason to do it (especially on higher levels). Fake circulation lasts 20 seconds and is better with Anatomy/Medicine skill (highest).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Can now put IV bags etc on rollerbeds and use them as IV stands for buckled people. Click with beaker to add it. Click with empty hand on empty (no buckled guy) bed to remove it. Drag bed on people to hook/unhook.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Damaged livers no longer generate ammonia. It was creating self-perpetuating damage which wasn't intended, it was for diagnostic memes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds auto-CPR device. Goes into victim's suit slot. It won't do mouth-to-mouth or resusticate them, but it will help with circulation. Needs Basic Anatomy and Medicine skills to use, or risk rib fracture. Basically continuously applies circulation part of CPR. Mapped bunch of them in medbay</li>
				<li class="tweak">Sleepers now have 10x stasis option. Their power usage now also scales with stasis factor greatly, 500 per factor, so ~5000 W at 10x</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Guns suck now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">When you have a gun in activa hand, you're considered to be 'aiming'. Moving or changing active hand resets timer.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Aiming gives bonuses to accuracy, longer you aim, capped by accuracy of the gun - so no point in aiming longer than few secs with pistol, but with sniper rifle, take your time.</li>
				<li class="tweak">If you haven't stood still for at least a second, you get penalties based on size of your gun. Pistols are almost not affected, but rifles are affected greatly.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Accuracy falloff differs for different calibers. Pistol rounds are best used 4 tiles or closer, rifles can be used from any range without ok results. Lasers mirror that setup, with higher range.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Overall, pistols are now useless at range, but don't suffer much if you move around or change hand to do something else.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Rifles are oppsite, can hit if you aim even from other end of screen, but if you move around, you're not going to hit shit.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Moving around (not towards gun) will make you harder to hit now. Yakkety sax away.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a small bells ringing sound playing when you regain consciousness. Will only play if player is considered AFK (currently 5 minutes without activity)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Spookerton updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Mercenary and Raider game modes no longer do early round-end votes when the antagonists leave or die.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">afterthought2 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">Guns and armor are no longer available in personal command lockers.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The bridge sidearms closet now also has three sets of command armor.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">10 February 2019</h2>
			<h3 class="author">SierraKomodo updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="maptweak">Added rechargers to merchant shuttle and merchant base</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Connected Flight Control disposal bin to pipe network</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added borg rechargers to communal brig and merchant's station</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">comma updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Uplink gun selection for traitors was scaled down. Assault rifles and similary big guns are gone, only pistol-likes available now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Wall of text about clothing items property is moved to a codex entry for the item, instead of being shown on every examine.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">sabiram updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="maptweak">The king of goats in the hydrobase planetary ruin has been retired.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">09 February 2019</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Anton-Kr updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Adds Vox ship and base to the game. It's join-able as a submap.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">08 February 2019</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Datraen updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes incorrect access on hangar maintenance doors.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">07 February 2019</h2>
			<h3 class="author">comma updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">The year is 2307 now. Roleplay accordingly.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">sabiram updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added explosive harpoons to the uplink. These will only explode upon embedding in a target, by throwing it at them or sticking them close up.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Increased the base harpoon's throwing force divisor.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">06 February 2019</h2>
			<h3 class="author">ghostsheet updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="maptweak">Rearranged the Guppy's interior for quality of life conveniences.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Radiation collector arrays will now fail catastrophically if exposed to extreme temperatures, such as those found within the supermatter core.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">The robotics lab has been messed with again, everything should work now hopefully.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">05 February 2019</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Anticept updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Pilot skill description now clarifies random movement occurs until trained or greater, regardless of what ship you are flying.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed phoron glass sheet's melting temperature so that reinforced phoron glass is consistent with the pre-material overhaul melting temperature. This should stop the random window breakage in the engine core until close to delamination temperatures.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Due to the nature of the material overhaul and this change, regular un-reinforced phoron glass also gets its temperature significantly buffed. It's still weak to physical attack by comparison to reinforced phoron glass.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Cakey updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="maptweak">Added LPA equipment closet to the Workplace Liason's office.</li>

				<li class="tweak">You can now put people onto wall frames with grabs</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Chinsky updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added an exploration shotgun. It's in a wall locker on Charon, along with ammo, replacing netgun. What can possibly go wrong?</li>
				<li class="rscadd">It can fire freely off-ship, but onboard you gotta register and get XO or CO to authorize it. Yes it's pain, yes it's intended.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">It is only guaranteed to work with types of ammo it ships with - beanbags, flash, net rounds. Loading combat ammo voids warranty and may result in fun.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Datraen updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">

				<li class="bugfix">You now need to be an EC scientist to select an EC labcoat in loadout. Senior Researchers and Assistants now have access to some of the same stuff as normal scientists that they lacked. Also adds some equipment the biomech should have access to.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Non-senior researcher Ensigns in the science department are now properly considered officers and have an officer's uniform given to them when they wake up instead of an enlisted uniform.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Labcoats can now be issued via the uniform vendor for EC science people.</li>
