			<h2 class="date">21 February 2017</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Asanadas updated:</h3>

				<li class="bugfix">Mushroom soup can now be made with a sane ingredient combination.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Accounts with biggest profits or losses are now announced in round end summary. Get dat greentext.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Surgery changes. Cry, medical.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Self-surgery is legal now. It was possible via a bug, it's a feature now.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">As a side effect, you don't have to lie down to be operated on. It is, however, a very bad idea unless it's basic steps like incision etc. Success chance will drop for delicate steps.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Instead of randomly doing nothing, rollerbeds / tables are factored into surgery success chance calculation.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Said success chance: surgery steps now can fail even if you don't move / drop tools etc. Ideal scenario is 'sober surgeon not in pain operating on another person who is lying on an optable'. Deviations from that add chance of failure. Some steps are more robust, some are more delicate. As a rule of a thumb, if you have to touch innards, that's delicate. If you perform internal organ surgery on yourself while sitting on a table piss drunk, nearly passing out from pain and also being blind, it's not going to go very smooth.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Shock will advance fast when being surgery'd on, so take it slow or take some pills.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added Supermatter Monitoring program, available on all devices. It provides various information on the supermatter engine. It is fully variable, and capable of working with multiple supermatter crystals at once (for those enterprising engineers among you).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Among other information, the supermatter monitor program shows engine core EPR value. This value is best kept between 1 and 2, and shows real amount of coolant in the core (in standard canisters worth). Normal EPR with two canisters in each loop is roughly 1.5</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Rightclick open/close laptop verb no longer exists for laptops. Use alt-click instead.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Blobs are now considerably more resistant to energetic weapons, be it handheld lasers, energy guns, or even emitters. An emitter is still useful to suppress the blob a bit, but one emitter shouldn't be capable of outright killing the blob.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blob has a relatively small chance to grow secondary cores. These cores are considerably weaker, have lower health, but still help spread the blob a bit more.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Emitter power usage increased (30kW to 100kW). While it is still possible to run one with PACMAN, you have to keep it on overload.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reinforced walls are now considerably more resistant against projectiles of all kinds, be it emitters, handheld weaponry, or anything else. Regular walls are unaffected. An emitter is still useful if you need to burn through one, but expect to wait - it needs over fifty pulses for a plasteel reinforced wall.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Details on the above. Reinforcement is calculated from the material that is used to reinforce the girders when building the wall. Weak materials such as wood have 0% reduction in taken damage. Most basic materials have 50% or so. Steel is decent material with 80% reduction. Plasteel is very good with 90%, and titanium is the best with approx. 92% reduction (though it has lower overall health)</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed bubble shield generators, hull shield generators and shield capacitors. Also removed shield disrupter.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a replacement advanced shield generator, that has a combined function of a capacitor, and both shield generators (hull shielding is toggleable). This shield generator must be built and once constructed is immobile (but can be deconstructed again). These generators are fully configurable, have better hull shielding that doesn't block shuttles, mass drivers and others, and have different energy system. Damage will drain the shield's energy directly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Shield Diffusers. Two variants exist - floor mounted and handheld. The handheld variant can be purchased from traitor uplink, and runs on an internal cell. The floor mounted variant layers under floor tiles and is APC powered. These diffusers dissipate shields in adjacent tiles (+ shaped pattern). The generator can be set to try to counter these, in which case each diffuser causes major EM strain on the shield.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added two shield generator circuit boards and two shield diffuser circuit boards into tech storage.</li>

The power restoration routine now provides better feedback to the AI if it fails, such as, whether the APC is broken or only discharged, etc.</li>
