Deviations from that add chance of failure. Some steps are more robust, some are more delicate. As a rule of a thumb, if you have to touch innards, that's delicate.

				<li class="tweak">Blobs are now considerably more resistant to energetic weapons, be it handheld lasers, energy guns, or even emitters. An emitter is still useful to suppress the blob a bit, but one emitter shouldn't be capable of outright killing the blob.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Blob has a relatively small chance to grow secondary cores. These cores are considerably weaker, have lower health, but still help spread the blob a bit more.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Emitter power usage increased (30kW to 100kW). While it is still possible to run one with PACMAN, you have to keep it on overload.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reinforced walls are now considerably more resistant against projectiles of all kinds, be it emitters, handheld weaponry, or anything else. Regular walls are unaffected. An emitter is still useful if you need to burn through one, but expect to wait - it needs over fifty pulses for a plasteel reinforced wall.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Details on the above. Reinforcement is calculated from the material that is used to reinforce the girders when building the wall. Weak materials such as wood have 0% reduction in taken damage. Most basic materials have 50% or so. Steel is decent material with 80% reduction. Plasteel is very good with 90%, and titanium is the best with approx. 92% reduction (though it has lower overall health)</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed bubble shield generators, hull shield generators and shield capacitors. Also removed shield disrupter.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a replacement advanced shield generator, that has a combined function of a capacitor, and both shield generators (hull shielding is toggleable). This shield generator must be built and once constructed is immobile (but can be deconstructed again). These generators are fully configurable, have better hull shielding that doesn't block shuttles, mass drivers and others, and have different energy system. Damage will drain the shield's energy directly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Shield Diffusers. Two variants exist - floor mounted and handheld. The handheld variant can be purchased from traitor uplink, and runs on an internal cell. The floor mounted variant layers under floor tiles and is APC powered. These diffusers dissipate shields in adjacent tiles (+ shaped pattern). The generator can be set to try to counter these, in which case each diffuser causes major EM strain on the shield.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Added two shield generator circuit boards and two shield diffuser circuit boards into tech storage.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Random event probabilities have been changed a bit. This is mostly noticeable with electrical storms, which should be less common now.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Electrical storm now shuts down APCs for longer duration which is controlled by event severity. APCs with critical flag are now affected too, but are only shut down for a short time in comparison to others.</li>
				<li class="tweak">EMPs are no longer one-hit kills for AIs - APCs with critical flag take reduced damage from EMPs, and AI's power restoration routine now resets the APC that may have been EMPed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">AI's power usage has been overhauled. Under the hood changes should improve reliability a bit and take more scenarios in consideration. The power restoration routine now provides better feedback to the AI if it fails, such as, whether the APC is broken or only discharged, etc.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">AI now has a Shutdown verb that can be used to reduce it's power usage five times. This disables AI's control, cameras, and most communications as if it was without power. This verb acts as a toggle, so it can be used again to turn yourself back on.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">AI now has Toggle Power Override verb that can be used to disable power saving mode when it loses APC power. This results in much faster discharge of internal capacitor, but allows you to operate as if you were powered. Can be toggled at any time.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Good news to the roboticists! The long waited firmware update for the bots has arrived. You can expect the following changes:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Medbots have improved the disease detection algorithms.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Floorbot firmware has been bugtested. In particular, they will no longer get stuck near the windows, hopelessly trying to fix the floor under the glass.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Floorbots have also received an internal low-power metal synthesizer. They will use it to make their own tiles. Slowly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Following the complains from humanitarian organizations regarding securitron brutality, stength of their stunners has been toned down. They will also politely demand that you get on the floor before arresting you. Except for the taser-mounted guys, they will still tase you down.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Other minor fixes.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The lasertag bots are now forbidden to build and use following the incident #1526672. Please don't let it happen again.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The farmbot design has been finished! Made from a watertank, robot arm, plant analyzer, bucket, minihoe and a proximity sensor, these small (not really) bots will be a useful companion to any gardener and/or xenobotanist.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Spider learning alert: they have learned to recognize the bots and will mercilessly attack them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">An experimental CPU upgrade would theoretically allow any of the bots to function with the same intelligence capacity as the maintenance drones. We still have no idea what causes it to boot up. Science!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">INCOMING TRANSMISSION: Greetings to agents, pirates, operatives, and anyone who otherwise uses our equipment. Following the NT update of bot firmware, we have updated the cryptographic sequencer's hacking routines as well. The medbots you emag will not poison you anymore, the clanbots won't clean after themselves immediately, and floorbots... wear a space suit. Oh, and it works on the new farmbots, too.</li>
