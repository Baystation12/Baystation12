			<h3 class="author">Cakey updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="maptweak">Added Deck 5, an expansion of Deck 4 adding more verticality to the ship beyond stairs and ladders. Deck 4 has been split up to accomodate these changes.</li>

				<li class="maptweak">The Petrov has been made slightly bigger to be more useful. Moved several research suites to the Petrov.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Research Director and Corporate Liason can now use the ID program to modify accesses within their own department. Petrov accesses are now only modifiable by the Research Director and NTL</li>
				<li class="tweak">Fixes the commissarry shutter access requirement.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Miraviel updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="maptweak">Repositioned lights in the SEA's office, the XO's and CO's request consoles, the fire extinguisher cabinets on the Bridge, the labels at the stairs, and the CO's light switch. Removed the overlapping Nanomed from the Bridge and the urinal from the Aquila.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">28 September 2018</h2>
			<h3 class="author">sabiram updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Added a delay to welding/unwelding airlocks.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xenolife Technicians no longer have access to the fabrication lab or Petrov helm.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="date">27 September 2018</h2>
			<h3 class="author">CrimsonShrike updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Rigs can now be hacked after lifting wire cover with a screwdriver.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Rig modules and cells are now removed with wrench.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">ParadoxSpace updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Adds the Yeosa'Unathi subspecies, their language, their faction, and their attack. Also gives Yeosa glowing eyes.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Lowers how hungry Unathi are at the expense of slower healing.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes issue with tail attack messages.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">After much debate as to whether Yeosa count as Unathi, the Expeditionary Corps have finally allowed Yeosa to wear Unathi cultural clothing from the loadout.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Unathi can now no longer manually toggle on and off involuntary processes like self-healing.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Textor updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="maptweak">Bridge Deck - Captain's quarters' light switch is moved so that you are no longer likely to remove the light tube when turning the lights on.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Deck 1 - Xenoflora and Miscellaneous labs are now brighter. This should allow for scientists to actually see the things they work on. Robotics now has solid doors. Privacy windows are no longer thwarted by looking through the door-windows. Added a window to the mech bay side to compensate for the lack of visibility from that direction due to the door no longer having a window. Door to storage next to robotics actually opens for the roboticist now. Removed power cable to nowhere in deck 1 starboard fore maintenance. Swaps the filing cabinet and table in the morgue so that the paper bin, folder, and pen are actually accessible when someone is working in there.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Deck 2 - Adds a shield diffuser at the edge of the old brig border so trash will stop being stuck behind the shields when ejected into space from the trash room. The shield should no longer block the airlock in deck 2 starboard mid maintenance due to wall unevenness.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Deck3 - Adds a second mineral bath to deck 3 cryogenic storage wardrobe. Moves photocopier and shredder in office so that they can both be used normally.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Deck 4 - The toxins storage room is now directly off the hangar in order to let scientists actually get to their toxins storage room. Finally adds a security camera to the fuel bay. The AI can now watch the fascinating process of refueling. Moves the atmos control computer in the Petrov Laboratory so that you can actually reach all the counter space when working.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Had a long discussion with the OR computers and we both agreed that they need to actually face the direction they were mapped in.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Zuhayr updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added a crashed escape pod that may generate on exoplanets and allow for latejoiners a la Bearcat.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Some ruins and submaps will add themselves to the distress signal list. Probably worth checking now.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Prevented submap jobs from being test-spawned by the global datum system as they do not expect null args.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">afterthought2 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">The IT skill now has gameplay effects when using modular computers.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Higher IT skill allows the user to bypass logging on program download with higher probability (Trained: 30%, Expert: 60%, Master: 90%). Logs will still be generated, with faked entries for the download info.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The antag access decryption program is more effective at higher skill levels. It works faster and has a chance to avoid tripping the alarm. At unskilled (generally meaning non-antag) it has a chance to give the wrong access.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The antag camera alarm-trip probability is now tied to skill, with similar effectiveness as current at Trained.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The antag dos program is more effective at higher skill, with more dos attacks per tick at higher levels (equal to current at Basic). At expert and master, gives extra fake attacking nodes to the system log to impede sysadmins.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The network monitor, email administration, and AI management programs are locked below basic, basic, and trained skill, resp. You will instead get some random data displayed. The programs do link to a terminal now.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a command line interface for modular computers. With enough skill (expert+ for most things) you can run specific commands (type man for a list) to do rudimentary sysadmin diagnostic tasks. Notably, with network access, you can ssh into terminals of other computers over the network. If you are unskilled, you may get various failure effects or just be unable to do anything.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">To access the terminal, either use one of the programs or use Ctl Alt Click.</li>
