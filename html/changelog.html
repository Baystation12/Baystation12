			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">The chem grinder is dangerous to use at "Unskilled" in Chemistry and will lose some ingredients depending on skill level.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The chem dispenser will give inaccurate amounts of ingredients or add extra contaminating ingredients when below skill "Trained" (in Chemistry or Cooking, depending on dispenser)  Can be slightly dangerous.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The chem master now has two modes. "Quick" will move the correct amount of ingredients from beaker to buffer, but also add contaminants (depending on skill). "Thorough" will only move the desired ingredient, but incur losses (depending on skill). Skill checked is Chemistry for chem master, Cooking for Condimaster.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Moving ingredients from buffer to waste or beaker acts like on "Quick" mode.</li>

			<h2 class="date">13 June 2018</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Cakey updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="imageadd">New wall sprites have been added.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">New door sprites have been added.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">New window sprites have been added.</li>
				<li class="imageadd">New grille sprites have been added.</li>

			<h3 class="author">ZeroBits updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Material Grinders have been reworked to allow different reagent quantities and multiple reagents when grinding material sheets</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Zuhayr updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Gas inhalation effects are now reagent-based. Gases create reagents inside the body, which then apply effects. This means that gaseous phoron exposure, for example, needs to be treated with dialysis/dylovene, as it fills your guts up with liquid phoron.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The poison_type var on species datums is now poison_types, and determines which poison gasses show you the toxins UI indicator, rather than which ones cause poisoning. The actual effects of poisonous gasses is determined by the reagent value (as per dexalin being injected into a vox, etc.). This really shouldn't impact anything for the average player, except that chlorine and nitrogen dioxide (not N2O, for clarity) are now actually poisonous.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Helium now makes your voice squeaky. Very important feature.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xenon is now functionally the same as N2O, including the following note.</li>
				<li class="tweak">N2O now causes giggling, confusion, dizziness and occasional passing out at high dosages, rather than instant and immediate knockout. Still useful for riot control and now flooding it into distro isn't a round-ender. You might even be able to use it without admins shouting at you! Refer to the optable neural suppressor PR for a replacement method to sedate people for surgery.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Finally, as a sidenote, Bogani will actually be poisoned by oxygen and chlorine will have a visible overlay now.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">afterthought2 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Experienced in Chemistry allows you to see scannable reagents in a held beaker/container.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Professional in Chemistry allows you to see all reagents in a held container.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Science goggles give more precise volume readings at higher chem skill.</li>
			</ul>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">afterthought2 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Lactate is a reagent that increases heart rate, causes generally harmless shortness of breath, and slows movement. After processing a large amount of lactate, mobs may experience temporary jitters.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Instead of producing adrenaline, pulling produces lactate.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Robots can now interact with storage items like boxes and bags.</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">afterthought2 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Throwing "huge" items (e.g. roller beds, backpacks, certain guns, rigs, jetpacks) or normal sized mobs without "Basic" skill in "Athletics" will briefly weaken you (and the items won't go far).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Thrown items don't go as far and have less speed/force if you have lower "Athletics" skill.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The weightlifting machine at the gym has more weight levels. Having high "Athletics" means you can lift more. If you try lifting way more than you are capable of, you may hurt yourself.</li>
