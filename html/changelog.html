			<h3 class="author">Chinsky updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Cryobags, cryo and general stasis changes. Main point is that stasis is no longer binary on/off, it doesn't stop life ticking, just slows it down (usually a lot). It chemical processing is slowed down too, so sometimes bigger stasis is not better.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cryo. Being very cold now provides stasis on its own - and cryo is easiest way of doing it. At 80K, it applies 20x stasis factor (life ticks once in 40 seconds instead once in 2).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cryo chemless healing was slowed down a bit. It also no longer magically multiplies chems in beakers by 10x. Cryox/clonex adjusted to work at same efficiency with this change.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cold damage in cryo is now prevented by clonex or cryox, not cryopod itself. On one hand you now NEED to have it in beaker if you care about patient, on another - you don't need cryopod if you have those and sufficiently cold place.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Cryobags. Cryobags no longer last forever. Their power drops every 5 minutes - examine to see current. It starts at 20x and loses 25% every time, so 20x to 15x to 11x in 10 minutes and so on. Will drop into nothingness at ~40 minutes mark.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Stasis will make you drowsy, and at higher stasis settings you will fall asleep eventually (15x or higher).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Sleepers can into stasis too! They have three settings: none, 3x and 5x.</li>
