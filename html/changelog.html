				<li class="rscadd">Number of overmap events increased. Asteroid fields now spread over wider space but have gaps in them.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Shrapnel is less deadly now. Tiny items don't jostle around anymore. They still prevent wounds they're embedded in from healing.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Conductive things embedded in body will heat up in EMP, dealing damage depending on their size and EMP severity.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Brainwashing implants! Well, kinda. XO now has a box of 'imprinting' implants, that can be set to a list of instructions, and will remind about those to whoever is implanted with it. Latest word in grimdark on-job training. They're not binding, just reminders.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Now the fun part is their abuse - when victim has mindbreaker in blood and implanted with those, implant wires deep enough to fool host that he actually believes these. Think borg laws. You can get the kit in uplink too, bundled with a dose of mindbreaker</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Can now emag practice carbines to get lethal lasers out of them. They'll turn useless after 3-6 shots so bring a lot! Costs an emag charge.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Not having enough air in lungs will prevent you from talking efficiently. If you don't have air at all, you might use remaining air in lungs for one message. If you're just not getting enough, you'll be stuck whispering. Long messages might come out garbled.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Pulse now affects blood circulation. Lower pulse effectively lowers it and vice versa.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Extremely high pulse risks damaging the heart. Shouldn't be a lot, but it's there.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">As you lose blood oxygenation, your pulse tries to rise to compensate. Thready (>250) pulse will cause a cardiac arrest.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Inaprovaline tries to bring pulse to normal levels, either up or down. It also prevents thready pulse.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Heart stopping is slightly less 100% surefire, so if you manage to get heart restarted it might beat for few ticks first.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You no longer need lungs/mouth to give CPR, but you will only do the heart bit. Checks still apply for mouth-to-mouth.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Shock stage stars rising earlier now (30 damage vs 50) and can go bit higher than usual.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Painkillers speed changed. Now they ramp up slower if ingested, but stay longer. Opposite if injected.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Tramadol and oxcodone injectors added to medical vendomats (and tramadol ones to hacked firstaid vendomats).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds some goodies to survival boxes - inapro injector, food and light.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Changed how tramadol/oxycodone work a bit. They now have period for setting in and wearing off, gradually ramping power up/down. Those are short, ~20 seconds to reach max</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mixing those with alcohol is now as bad idea as it's supposed to be - increased liver damage and respiratory depression (harder time beathing) await you</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Inaprovaline helps against breathing effects of both mixing and ODing.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There's now some effects based on how much you consume over time, rather than single dose. Effects stat at 15u with some slowdown and chance to start slurring, ramp up from there, with major slowdown and slurring after OD-worthy doses is metabolized.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Also ODing on those will give you even MORE painkilling effect! At a small cost of suffocating most likely, and don't even try doing that AND booze.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ships now have sensors. Overmap is dark by default, with known sectors emitting some light. Dust/rocks/ion block visibility. You can control the sensor with console(s) on the bridge, its power setting sets how far it will shine. Higher settings use /huge/ mounts of power so don't leave it running on those. Sensors also cannot run in non-vacuum.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Some improvements to helm console - now shows ETA to next grid, can set max speed for autopilot.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Engines are now buildable - there's circuitboards for them in Tech storage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Merchant prices are now slightly less wack, they use actual procs for deciding them, instead of selling containeres full of stuff at price of container only.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Mineral scanners now store survey data, currently useless aside from penile comparsions.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">New away mission - a drifting empty ship. Can be restored to fly around on its own like Torch.</li>
