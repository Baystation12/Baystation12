				<li class="tweak">Grilles have had most of their radiation resistance removed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Low walls and windows have had their rad resistance halved, so they add up to a full 100% instead of 200%.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">MistakeNot4892 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added a more involved butchery system.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Adds a Vox RIG. Same statline as the Industrial RIG, but with full temperature and radiation resistance. Vox had no way to scavenge radioactive or volcanic planets up until now.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds flux cannon. Essentially a Vox AEG, but with the lasers doing brute damage, and shock mode replaced by a mode that scatters low damage pellets in a burst.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds sonic cannon. A vox stun rifle, with a mode that uses up all the gun's charge to push, deafen, and dizzy an opponent. Ear protection such as helmets and earmuffs will negate the deafening, and reduce the dizziness.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">The shield generator has been reworked. It is now much more expensive to keep the shields on continuously, and for large shields it's likely not viable.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The shield generator now has an idle and active state (as well as the off state). In the idle state, it consumes limited power and does not generate a shield. In the active state, it consumes a lot of power and produces a shield.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If an idle generator is toggled on, it takes a short amount of time to spin up to active state. If an active generator is toggled to idle, it will switch to that state instantly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There are several levels of idle power usage that can be selected. Higher power usage decreases the spin-up time proportionately.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The shield generator takes time to adjust the radius of the shield. The radius will not be adjusted while the shield is active.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The shield generator's power storage has been vastly expanded.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The shield generator's field integrity is now tracked separately from the power storage (it's determined by the amount of power stored, up to a threshold).</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">mikomyazaki updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Radiation collectors are now capped at 500kW output at 250Bq radiation. They are more efficient at lower radiation levels.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Radiation collectors will have variable fuel usage, capping out at 250Bq radiation. Fuel usage increased significantly (1-10x depending on radiation levels)</li>
				<li class="tweak">Radiation collectors will now break from high radiation levels (500Bq) as well as temperature, they will display a warning and play a warning sound.</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Stowaways can no longer spawn in the incinerator room, which they cannot leave.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes inconsistent icon names for female jumpsuit icons. Should work for rolling down / roll sleeves for all jumpsuits/suits now.</li>
