# Custom items go here. They are modifications of existing paths; look at the example for details.
# Item will spawn if the target has one of the req_titles and if their on-spawn ID has the required access level.
# req_access is going to be a shit to maintain since the config file can't grab constants and has to use integers, use it minimally.
# Separate titles with a single comma and a space (', ') or they'll bork.
#
# EX:
# {
# ckey: zuhayr
# character_name: Jane Doe
# item_path: /obj/item/toy/plushie
# item_name: ugly plush toy
# item_icon: flagmask     
# item_desc: It's truly hideous.
# req_titles: Assistant, Security Officer
# req_access: 1
# }
#
# {
# ckey: zuhayr
# character_name: Jane Doe
# item_path: /obj/item/device/kit/paint
# item_name: APLU customisation kit
# item_desc: A customisation kit with all the parts needed to turn an APLU into a "Titan's Fist" model.
# kit_name: APLU "Titan's Fist"
# kit_desc: Looks like an overworked, under-maintained Ripley with some horrific damage.
# kit_icon: titan
# additional_data: ripley, firefighter
# }
#
# {
# ckey: zuhayr
# character_name: Jane Doe
# item_path: /obj/item/device/kit/suit
# item_name: salvage suit customisation kit
# item_desc: A customisation kit with all the parts needed to convert a suit.
