## This file is full of settings to aid in development and debugging. Nothing in here is intended for use in a live server, and these settings aren't even useful for runtime administration, just delete the whole file in any live config. Internal testing only.

## Autostart: Uncomment this option to force the round to be automatically started as soon as possible, instead of having the 3 minute wait period
## Code for this is located in ticker.dm, Initialize proc
#AUTO_START

## Auto-observe: Uncomment this to force players to be immediately spawned as observer-ghosts instead of being left at the menu. They will need to respawn to use character setup
## Code for this is located in ticker.dm, start_now proc
#AUTO_OBSERVE

## Auto-BST: When uncommented, this option will cause anyone who enters observer mode to immediately spawn as a bluespace technician, if they have the permissions to do so
## Code for this is located in ticker.dm, start_now proc
#AUTO_BST

## No Overmap: When uncommented, this will prevent generation of overmap, exoplanets, away sites, and any other locations outside of the ship. Thus greatly speeding server startup
#NO_OVERMAP
