Nano UI Template Guide
--------------------------------

Nano UI uses templates, which are comprised of HTML and a markup syntax. The markup allows you 
to easily add conditionals (if statements), loops (for loops) and custom formatting (using helpers).

Templates are stored in the /nano/templates folder and the file extension is .tmpl.
