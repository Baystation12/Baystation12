// Something to remember when setting priorities: SS_TICKER runs before Normal, which runs before SS_BACKGROUND.
// Each group has its own priority bracket.
// SS_BACKGROUND handles high server load differently than Normal and SS_TICKER do.
// Higher priority also means a larger share of a given tick before sleep checks.
