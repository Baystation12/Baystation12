/*
	Modified DynamicAreaLighting for TGstation - Coded by Carnwennan

	This is TG's 'new' lighting system. It's basically a heavily modified combination of Forum_Account's and
	ShadowDarke's respective lighting libraries. Credits, where due, to them.

	Like sd_DAL (what we used to use), it changes the shading overlays of areas by splitting each type of area into sub-areas
	by using the var/tag variable and moving turfs into the contents list of the correct sub-area. This method is
	much less costly than using overlays or objects.

	Unlike sd_DAL however it uses a queueing system. Everytime we call a change to opacity or luminosity
	(through SetOpacity() or SetLuminosity()) we are  simply updating variables and scheduling certain lights/turfs for an
	update. Actual updates are handled periodically by the lighting_controller. This carries additional overheads, however it
	means that each thing is changed only once per lighting_controller.processing_interval ticks. Allowing for greater control
	over how much priority we'd like lighting updates to have. It also makes it possible for us to simply delay updates by
	setting lighting_controller.processing = 0 at say, the start of a large explosion, waiting for it to finish, and then
	turning it back on with lighting_controller.processing = 1.

	Unlike our old system there are hardcoded maximum luminositys (different for certain atoms).
	This is to cap the cost of creating lighting effects.
	(without this, an atom with luminosity of 20 would have to update 41^2 turfs!) :s

	Also, in order for the queueing system to work, each light remembers the effect it casts on each turf. This is going to
	have larger memory requirements than our previous system but it's easily worth the hassle for the greater control we
	gain. It also reduces cost of removing lighting effects by a lot!

	Known Issues/TODO:
		Shuttles still do not have support for dynamic lighting (I hope to fix this at some point)
		No directional lighting support. (prototype looked ugly)
