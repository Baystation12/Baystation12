/*
	Computer3 portable computer.

	Battery powered only; it does not use the APC network at all.

	When picked up, becomes an inert item.  This item can be put in a recharger,
	or set down and re-opened into the original machine.  While closed, the computer
	has the MAINT stat flag.  If you want to ignore this, you will have to bitmask it out.

	The unused(?) alt+click will toggle laptops open and closed.  If we find a better
	answer for this in the future, by all means use it.  I just don't want it limited
	to the verb, which is SIGNIFICANTLY less accessible than shutting a laptop.
	Ctrl-click would work for closing the machine, since it's anchored, but not for
	opening it back up again.  And obviously, I don't want to override shift-click.
	There's no double-click because that's used in regular click events.  Alt-click is the
	only obvious one left.
