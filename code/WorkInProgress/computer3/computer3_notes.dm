	1. Do NOT confuse Computer.Crash(errorcode) with byond CRASH(message)
	2  Do NOT talk about fight club.
	3  If this if your first night here, you have to crash the computer.
	4  Where am I?
	5  Someone help me, please...
	6. Be sure to use computer.use_power() appropriately.  Laptops should run out of battery occasionally.
	7  Everyone fights, no-one quits.  If you don't do your job, I'll crash you myself.
	6  Don't allow more than 42 angels to dance on the head of a pin.
	5. Once a computer has spawned, they are just like the rest, except when they aren't.
	4  Get me four glasses of apple juice.
	3. Components are only added or removed when disassembled and rebuilt.  However, they may be EMP'd.
	2  Only you can prevent friendly fire.
	1  Do not talk about fight club.
	2. If a component subtype needs to be handled separately (removable drives, radio networks), declare it separately.
	3  Television rules the nation
	4. interactable() does all the sanity checks, adds fingerprints, sets machines, initializes popup, and makes a damn fine pot of coffee.
	5  Love conquers all.
	6  If at all possible, do a barrel roll.
	7. Don't forget to use the network verify function to make sure you still have access to remote machines.




	TODO:
	*	"Nothing left to call the shuttle" check
	*	Communications terminal printing - move it to a printer of some sort?  Make a printer peripheral--but then which ones print the comms?
	*	Remove the partially transparent border on program screens, as it clashes with some frames
	*	Chop the corners on program screens now that screen sizes are standard
	*	NTOS:
		*	Needs a text editor/viewer
		*	Needs file copy and file move - I think I know how I'm gonna do it
		*	Needs a peripheral view (eject disks and cards, network actions, ???)
