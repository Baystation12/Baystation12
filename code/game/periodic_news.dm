			 			to increase revenue, has refactored several of their facilities to perform experiments
			 			on live humans, including virology research, genetic manipulation, and \"feeding them
			 			to the slimes to see what happens\". Allegedly, these test subjects were neither

						bridge today, and there are unconfirmed reports that the death toll has passed 50. The cause of
						the explosions remain unknown, but there is speculation that it might have something to do with
