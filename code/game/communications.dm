  HOW IT WORKS

  The radio_controller is a global object maintaining all radio transmissions, think about it as about "ether".
  Note that walkie-talkie, intercoms and headsets handle transmission using nonstandard way.
  procs:

    add_object(obj/device as obj, var/new_frequency as num, var/filter as text|null = null)
      Adds listening object.
      parameters:
        device - device receiving signals, must have proc receive_signal (see description below).
          one device may listen several frequencies, but not same frequency twice.
        new_frequency - see possibly frequencies below;
        filter - thing for optimization. Optional, but recommended.
                 All filters should be consolidated in this file, see defines later.
                 Device without listening filter will receive all signals (on specified frequency).
                 Device with filter will receive any signals sent without filter.
                 Device with filter will not receive any signals sent with different filter.
      returns:
       Reference to frequency object.

    remove_object (obj/device, old_frequency)
      Obliviously, after calling this proc, device will not receive any signals on old_frequency.
      Other frequencies will left unaffected.

   return_frequency(var/frequency as num)
      returns:
       Reference to frequency object. Use it if you need to send and do not need to listen.

  radio_frequency is a global object maintaining list of devices that listening specific frequency.
  procs:

    post_signal(obj/source as obj|null, datum/signal/signal, var/filter as text|null = null, var/range as num|null = null)
      Sends signal to all devices that wants such signal.
      parameters:
        source - object, emitted signal. Usually, devices will not receive their own signals.
        signal - see description below.
        filter - described above.
        range - radius of regular byond's square circle on that z-level. null means everywhere, on all z-levels.

  obj/proc/receive_signal(datum/signal/signal, var/receive_method as num, var/receive_param)
    Handler from received signals. By default does nothing. Define your own for your object.
    Avoid of sending signals directly from this proc, use spawn(-1). Do not use sleep() here please.
      parameters:
        signal - see description below. Extract all needed data from the signal before doing sleep(), spawn() or return!
        receive_method - may be TRANSMISSION_WIRE or TRANSMISSION_RADIO.
          TRANSMISSION_WIRE is currently unused.
        receive_param - for TRANSMISSION_RADIO here comes frequency.

  datum/signal
    vars:
    source
      an object that emitted signal. Used for debug and bearing.
    data
      list with transmitting data. Usual use pattern:
        data["msg"] = "hello world"
    encryption
      Some number symbolizing "encryption key".
      Note that game actually do not use any cryptography here.
      If receiving object don't know right key, it must ignore encrypted signal in its receive_signal.
