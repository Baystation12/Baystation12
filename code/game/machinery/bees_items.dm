				<h1>Raising Bees</h1>

				Bees are loving but fickle creatures. Don't mess with their hive and stay away from any clusters of them, and you'll avoid their ire.
				Sometimes, you'll need to dig around in there for those delicious sweeties though - in that case make sure you wear sealed protection gear
				and carry an extinguisher or smoker with you - any bees chasing you, once calmed down, can thusly be netted and returned safely to the hive.<br.
				<br>
				BeezEez is a cure-all panacea for them, but use it too much and the hive may grow to apocalyptic proportions. Other than that, bees are excellent pets
				for all the family and are excellent caretakers of one's garden: having a hive or two around will aid in the longevity and growth rate of plants,
				and aid them in fighting off poisons and disease.
