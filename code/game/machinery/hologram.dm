/*
Revised. Original based on space ninja hologram code. Which is also mine. /N
How it works:
AI clicks on holopad in camera view. View centers on holopad.
AI clicks again on the holopad to display a hologram. Hologram stays as long as AI is looking at the pad and it (the hologram) is in range of the pad.
AI can use the directional keys to move the hologram around, provided the above conditions are met and the AI in question is the holopad's master.
Only one AI may project from a holopad at any given time.
AI may cancel the hologram at any time by clicking on the holopad once more.

Possible to do for anyone motivated enough:
	Give an AI variable for different hologram icons.
	Itegrate EMP effect to disable the unit.
