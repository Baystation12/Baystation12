// HARDWARE TREE
//
// These abilities are dependent on hardware, they may not be researched. They are not tiered.
// Destroy Core - Allows the AI to initiate a 15 second countdown that will destroy it's core. Use again to stop countdown.
// Toggle APU Generator - Allows the AI to toggle it's integrated APU generator.
// Destroy Station - Allows the AI to initiate station self destruct. Takes 2 minutes, gives warnings to crew. Use again to stop countdown.
