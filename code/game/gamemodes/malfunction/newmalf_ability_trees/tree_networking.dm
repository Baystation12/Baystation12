// NETWORKING TREE
//
// Abilities in this tree are oriented around giving the AI more control of normally uncontrollable systems.
// T1 - Basic Encryption Hack - Allows hacking of APCs. Hacked APCs can be controlled even when AI Control is cut and give exclusive control to the AI and linked cyborgs.
// T2 - Advanced Encryption Hack - Allows the AI to send fake CentCom message. Has high chance of failing.
// T3 - Elite Encryption Hack - Allows the AI to change alert levels. Has high chance of failing.
// T4 - System Override - Allows the AI to rapidly hack remaining APCs. When completed, grants access to the self destruct nuclear warhead.
