That slim-suited, cryptic individual is an enigma to you and all of your knowledge. Their purpose is unknown. Their mission is unknown. How they arrived to this secure and isolated section of the galaxy, you don't know. What you do know is that there is a silent shadow-stalker piercing through the defenses of Nanotrasen with technological capabilities eons ahead of your time. They can avoid the omniscience of the AI and rival the most hardened weapons your station is capable of. Tread lightly and only hope this unknown assassin isn't here for you."
