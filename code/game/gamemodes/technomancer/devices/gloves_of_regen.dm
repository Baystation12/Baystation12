	designed to be slowly fed into a living person's system, increasing their metabolism greatly, resulting in accelerated healing.  \
	A side effect of this healing is that the wearer will generally get hungry a lot faster.  Sliding the gloves on and off also \
	hurts a lot.  As a bonus, the gloves are more resistant to the elements than most.  It should be noted that synthetics will have \
