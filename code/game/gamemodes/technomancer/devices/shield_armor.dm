	to provide a personal shield around you, which can diffuse laser beams and reduce the velocity of bullets and close quarters \
	weapons, reducing their potential for harm severely.  All of this comes at a cost of of requiring a large amount of energy, \
	of which your Core can provide.  When you are struck by something, the shield will block 75% of the damage, deducting energy \
	proportional to the amount of force that was inflicted.  Armor penetration has no effect on the shield's ability to protect \
	you from harm, however the shield will fail if the energy supply cannot meet demand."
