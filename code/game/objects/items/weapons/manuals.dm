				<h3>Singularity Safety in Special Circumstances</h3>

				<h4>Power outage</h4>

				A power problem has made the entire station loose power? Could be station-wide wiring problems or syndicate power sinks. In any case follow these steps:
				<p>
				<b>Step one:</b> <b><font color='red'>PANIC!</font></b><br>
				<b>Step two:</b> Get your ass over to engineering! <b>QUICKLY!!!</b><br>
				<b>Step three:</b> Get to the <b>Area Power Controller</b> which controls the power to the emitters.<br>
				<b>Step four:</b> Swipe it with your <b>ID card</b> - if it doesn't unlock, continue with step 15.<br>
				<b>Step five:</b> Open the console and disengage the cover lock.<br>
				<b>Step six:</b> Pry open the APC with a <b>Crowbar.</b><br>
				<b>Step seven:</b> Take out the empty <b>power cell.</b><br>
				<b>Step eight:</b> Put in the new, <b>full power cell</b> - if you don't have one, continue with step 15.<br>
				<b>Step nine:</b> Quickly put on a <b>Radiation suit.</b><br>
				<b>Step ten:</b> Check if the <b>singularity field generators</b> withstood the down-time - if they didn't, continue with step 15.<br>
				<b>Step eleven:</b> Since disaster was averted you now have to ensure it doesn't repeat. If it was a powersink which caused it and if the engineering apc is wired to the same powernet, which the powersink is on, you have to remove the piece of wire which links the apc to the powernet. If it wasn't a powersink which caused it, then skip to step 14.<br>
				<b>Step twelve:</b> Grab your crowbar and pry away the tile closest to the APC.<br>
				<b>Step thirteen:</b> Use the wirecutters to cut the wire which is conecting the grid to the terminal. <br>
				<b>Step fourteen:</b> Go to the bar and tell the guys how you saved them all. Stop reading this guide here.<br>
				<b>Step fifteen:</b> <b>GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE!!!</b><br>
				</p>

				<h4>Shields get damaged</h4>

				Step one: <b>GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE!!! FORGET THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN, SAVE YOURSELF!!!</b><br>

<h1><span class="editsection"></span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Cloning"> Cloning </span></h1>
<p>You can clone people from scans made while they are alive and well (which is preferred). Feel free to call people to get their backups made - especially for Heads of Staff.
</p>
<h2><span class="editsection"></span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Scan"> Scan </span></h2>
<p>The first thing that a clone needs is a record in the cloning console. Scanning requires a dead or live human body (monkeys won't work), whereas making the actual clone requires the person to be dead.
</p>
<ol><li> Make sure the person is not wearing anything.
<ul><li> If the person is alive, have them strip.
</li><li> If the person is dead, click+drag their body onto yours to bring up their clothing window, then click on the links identifying each piece of clothing to remove it.
</li></ul>
</li><li></a> Grab the person.
</li><li> Click on the DNA scanner to place them inside.
</li><li> Click on the cloning console to bring up its menu.
</li><li> Click <b>Scan</b>.
<ul><li> <i>Note: If you see </i>Mental Interface Error<i>, wait a few seconds and try again. If it still comes up, the body is not viable for cloning (they logged off) and should be taken to the morgue.</i>
</li></ul>
</li><li> Click <b>View Records</b> to make sure their record is listed in the cloning database.
</li></ol>
<h2><span class="editsection"></span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Making_the_Clone"> Making the Clone </span></h2>
<p>Remember, a clone can only be made when the person you're making a clone for is dead. If they aren't dead, you'll see a "Unable to initiate cloning cycle" error in the Cloning System Control.
</p>
<ol><li> Head to the cloning console beside the cloning pod, and click on it to open its menu.
</li><li> Click <b>View Records</b>, select the person you wish to clone, then click <b>Clone</b>.
<ul><li> <i>Note: After clicking "Clone" the dead person will get a pop-up window asking if they want to come back to life. If they choose "No", the console will say "Unable to initiate cloning cycle". If they choose "Yes", the console will say "Cloning cycle activated", and their body will be remade in a few minutes.</i>
</li><li> <i>Note #2: When a new clone is made, that person's record is deleted from the database, so they must be <a href="/wiki/index.php/Geneticist#Scan" title="Geneticist">scanned</a> again if they are to be cloned a second time.</i>
</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<h2><span class="editsection"></span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Finishing_a_New_Clone"> Finishing a New Clone </span></h2>
<ol><li> Grab the new clone and take it to Cryo, the room with large cryo cells.
</li><li> Click on one of the cells to place the clone inside and set the <b>Cryo status</b> to <b>On</b>.
</li><li> Take a nearby beaker filled with Cryoxadone and then click on the same cell you placed the clone in to load the beaker into the cell.
<ul><li> <i>Note: At this point, the clone will begin to heal slowly, shown by the increasing health indication in the cryo cell's menu. If you wish to speed up the effect, continue with the next steps.</i>
</li></ul>
</li><li> Use the nearby on both O2 canisters to secure them (if they aren't already).
</li><li> Put the wrench down, then click on both O2 canisters and <b>Open</b> them.
</li><li> Set the freezer's <b>Target gas temperature</b> to its lowest amount by clicking on the far-left "-" until the number in the center no longer decreases.
</li><li> Set the freezer to <b>On</b>.
</li><li> Click on the cyro cell to check on your clone. When its health reaches 100, it is considered finished and can then be ejected (right-click &gt; Eject Occupant).
<ul><li> <i>Note: Though waiting for the health to reach 100 is optimum, in emergencies when the cryo cells are needed the clone can be ejected at ~50 health and finished in a sleeper.</i>
</li></ul>
</li><li> <b>Don't forget!</b> when you're done with the cryo room, turn everything to <b>Off</b> or <b>Closed</b> so the room doesn't get freezing cold! Also, if you still have their old body, drag it to the morgue to prevent <a href="/wiki/index.php/Clone_Memory_Disorder" title="Clone Memory Disorder" class="mw-redirect">Clone Memory Disorder</a> (which is purely for role-play purposes).
</li></ol>
<h2><span class="editsection"></span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Clone_Memory_Disorder"> Clone Memory Disorder </span></h2>
<p>There are a few basic rules that apply to most patients, all symptoms of <b>Clone Memory Disorder</b>.<br>
It is caused by the unexpected circumstances after awakening in cryo (if cloned from a backup), or the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma">traumatizing</a> experience of death which is much worse, (if cloned from the corpse).
</p><p>These are the usual symptoms.
</p>
<ol><li>They will be disoriented after being cloned.
</li><li>They will have forgotten about their death/everything that happened after the backup.
</li><li>They will sometimes feel strange urges or fears when confronted with anything that can be directly related to their death. (Only if cloned from the corpse). See also <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma#Symptoms_of_trauma">Symptoms of Trauma</a> for how people in reality would possibly react (read this if you are unsure how to RP Clone Memory Disorder for when you get cloned from a corpse).
</li></ol>
<p><b>This applies for cloned criminals as well!</b>
</p><p>Take an example clone. He died under suspicious circumstances, but we always take good care of our patients, and we do not want them to commit suicide or fall into manic depression. As such, we will have to prevent any <b>Post-Mortem Traumatic Relapses</b> (Refer to it as 'complications' to less scientific personnel).
</p>
<ul><li>The first thing to do is ask the patient how they feel.
</li><li>Symptom <b>1</b> of CMD will most of the time be apparent in the subject.
</li><li>They will most likely ask questions about why they are there.
</li><li>Give an excuse: Tell them that they have hurt their head, were wounded, or otherwise put into cryo. (You might also want to tell them that they fainted after their back-up, which is common for patients that were nervous to get into the machine.)
</li><li>Inform all involved personnel of the excuse.
</li></ul>

				<h1>Science For Dummies</h1>
				So you want to further SCIENCE? Good man/woman/thing! However, SCIENCE is a complicated process even though it's quite easy. For the most part, it's a three step process:
				<ol>
					<li> 1) Deconstruct items in the Destructive Analyzer to advance technology or improve the design.</li>
					<li> 2) Build unlocked designs in the Protolathe and Circuit Imprinter</li>
					<li> 3) Repeat!</li>
				</ol>

				Those are the basic steps to furthing science. What do you do science with, however? Well, you have four major tools: R&D Console, the Destructive Analyzer, the Protolathe, and the Circuit Imprinter.

				<h2>The R&D Console</h2>
				The R&D console is the cornerstone of any research lab. It is the central system from which the Destructive Analyzer, Protolathe, and Circuit Imprinter (your R&D systems) are controled. More on those systems in their own sections. On its own, the R&D console acts as a database for all your technological gains and new devices you discover. So long as the R&D console remains intact, you'll retain all that SCIENCE you've discovered. Protect it though, because if it gets damaged, you'll lose your data! In addition to this important purpose, the R&D console has a disk menu that lets you transfer data from the database onto disk or from the disk into the database. It also has a settings menu that lets you re-sync with nearby R&D devices (if they've become disconnected), lock the console from the unworthy, upload the data to all other R&D consoles in the network (all R&D consoles are networked by default), connect/disconnect from the network, and purge all data from the database.
				<b>NOTE:</b> The technology list screen, circuit imprinter, and protolathe menus are accessible by non-scientists. This is intended to allow 'public' systems for the plebians to utilize some new devices.

				<h2>Destructive Analyzer</h2>
				This is the source of all technology. Whenever you put a handheld object in it, it analyzes it and determines what sort of technological advancements you can discover from it. If the technology of the object is equal or higher then your current knowledge, you can destroy the object to further those sciences. Some devices (notably, some devices made from the protolathe and circuit imprinter) aren't 100% reliable when you first discover them. If these devices break down, you can put them into the Destructive Analyzer and improve their reliability rather then futher science. If their reliability is high enough ,it'll also advance their related technologies.

				<h2>Circuit Imprinter</h2>
				This machine, along with the Protolathe, is used to actually produce new devices. The Circuit Imprinter takes glass and various chemicals (depends on the design) to produce new circuit boards to build new machines or computers. It can even be used to print AI modules.

				<h2>Protolathe</h2>
				This machine is an advanced form of the Autolathe that produce non-circuit designs. Unlike the Autolathe, it can use processed metal, glass, solid plasma, silver, gold, and diamonds along with a variety of chemicals to produce devices. The downside is that, again, not all devices you make are 100% reliable when you first discover them.

				<h1>Reliability and You</h1>
				As it has been stated, many devices when they're first discovered do not have a 100% reliablity when you first discover them. Instead, the reliablity of the device is dependent upon a base reliability value, whatever improvements to the design you've discovered through the Destructive Analyzer, and any advancements you've made with the device's source technologies. To be able to improve the reliability of a device, you have to use the device until it breaks beyond repair. Once that happens, you can analyze it in a Destructive Analyzer. Once the device reachs a certain minimum reliability, you'll gain tech advancements from it.

				<h1>Building a Better Machine</h1>
				Many machines produces from circuit boards and inserted into a machine frame require a variety of parts to construct. These are parts like capacitors, batteries, matter bins, and so forth. As your knowledge of science improves, more advanced versions are unlocked. If you use these parts when constructing something, its attributes may be improved. For example, if you use an advanced matter bin when constructing an autolathe (rather then a regular one), it'll hold more materials. Experiment around with stock parts of various qualities to see how they affect the end results! Be warned, however: Tier 3 and higher stock parts don't have 100% reliability and their low reliability may affect the reliability of the end machine.

				  <li>Metal</li>
				  <li>Two Flashes</li>
				  <li>One Power Cell (Preferrably rated to 15000w)</li>
				  <li>Some electrical wires</li>
				  <li>One Human Brain</li>
				  <li>One Man-Machine Interface</li>
				</ul>
				Once you have acquired the materials, you can start on construction of your cyborg.<br>To construct a cyborg, follow the steps below:
				<ol>
				  <li>Start the Exosuit Fabricators constructing all of the cyborg parts</li>
				  <li>While the parts are being constructed, take your human brain, and place it inside the Man-Machine Interface</li>
				  <li>Once you have a Robot Head, place your two flashes inside the eye sockets</li>
				  <li>Once you have your Robot Chest, wire the Robot chest, then insert the power cell</li>
				  <li>Attach all of the Robot parts to the Robot frame</li>
				  <li>Insert the Man-Machine Interface (With the Brain inside) Into the Robot Body</li>
				  <li>Congratulations! You have a new cyborg!</li>
				</ol>

				<h2><a name="Maintenance">Cyborg Maintenance</h2>
				Occasionally Cyborgs may require maintenance of a couple types, this could include replacing a power cell with a charged one, or possibly maintaining the cyborg's internal wiring.

				<h3>Replacing a Power Cell</h3>
				Replacing a Power cell is a common type of maintenance for cyborgs. It usually involves replacing the cell with a fully charged one, or upgrading the cell with a larger capacity cell.<br>The steps to replace a cell are follows:
				<ol>
				  <li>Unlock the Cyborg's Interface by swiping your ID on it</li>
				  <li>Open the Cyborg's outer panel using a crowbar</li>
				  <li>Remove the old power cell</li>
				  <li>Insert the new power cell</li>
				  <li>Close the Cyborg's outer panel using a crowbar</li>
				  <li>Lock the Cyborg's Interface by swiping your ID on it, this will prevent non-qualified personnel from attempting to remove the power cell</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Exposing the Internal Wiring</h3>
				Exposing the internal wiring of a cyborg is fairly easy to do, and is mainly used for cyborg repairs.<br>You can easily expose the internal wiring by following the steps below:
				<ol>
				  <li>Follow Steps 1 - 3 of "Replacing a Cyborg's Power Cell"</li>
				  <li>Open the cyborg's internal wiring panel by using a screwdriver to unsecure the panel</li>
			  </ol>
			  To re-seal the cyborg's internal wiring:
			  <ol>
			    <li>Use a screwdriver to secure the cyborg's internal panel</li>
			    <li>Follow steps 4 - 6 of "Replacing a Cyborg's Power Cell" to close up the cyborg</li>
			  </ol>

			  <h2><a name="Repairs">Cyborg Repairs</h2>
			  Occasionally a Cyborg may become damaged. This could be in the form of impact damage from a heavy or fast-travelling object, or it could be heat damage from high temperatures, or even lasers or Electromagnetic Pulses (EMPs).

			  <h3>Dents</h3>
			  If a cyborg becomes damaged due to impact from heavy or fast-moving objects, it will become dented. Sure, a dent may not seem like much, but it can compromise the structural integrity of the cyborg, possibly causing a critical failure.
			  Dents in a cyborg's frame are rather easy to repair, all you need is to apply a welding tool to the dented area, and the high-tech cyborg frame will repair the dent under the heat of the welder.

        <h3>Excessive Heat Damage</h3>
        If a cyborg becomes damaged due to excessive heat, it is likely that the internal wires will have been damaged. You must replace those wires to ensure that the cyborg remains functioning properly.<br>To replace the internal wiring follow the steps below:
        <ol>
          <li>Unlock the Cyborg's Interface by swiping your ID</li>
          <li>Open the Cyborg's External Panel using a crowbar</li>
          <li>Remove the Cyborg's Power Cell</li>
          <li>Using a screwdriver, expose the internal wiring or the Cyborg</li>
          <li>Replace the damaged wires inside the cyborg</li>
          <li>Secure the internal wiring cover using a screwdriver</li>
          <li>Insert the Cyborg's Power Cell</li>
          <li>Close the Cyborg's External Panel using a crowbar</li>
          <li>Lock the Cyborg's Interface by swiping your ID</li>
        </ol>
        These repair tasks may seem difficult, but are essential to keep your cyborgs running at peak efficiency.

        <h2><a name="Emergency">In Case of Emergency</h2>
        In case of emergency, there are a few steps you can take.

        <h3>"Rogue" Cyborgs</h3>
        If the cyborgs seem to become "rogue", they may have non-standard laws. In this case, use extreme caution.
        To repair the situation, follow these steps:
        <ol>
          <li>Locate the nearest robotics console</li>
          <li>Determine which cyborgs are "Rogue"</li>
          <li>Press the lockdown button to immobolize the cyborg</li>
          <li>Locate the cyborg</li>
          <li>Expose the cyborg's internal wiring</li>
          <li>Check to make sure the LawSync and AI Sync lights are lit</li>
          <li>If they are not lit, pulse the LawSync wire using a multitool to enable the cyborg's Law Sync</li>
          <li>Proceed to a cyborg upload console. NanoTrasen usually places these in the same location as AI uplaod consoles.</li>
          <li>Use a "Reset" upload moduleto reset the cyborg's laws</li>
          <li>Proceed to a Robotics Control console</li>
          <li>Remove the lockdown on the cyborg</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>As a last resort</h3>
        If all else fails in a case of cyborg-related emergency. There may be only one option. Using a Robotics Control console, you may have to remotely detonate the cyborg.
        <h3>WARNING:</h3> Do not detonate a borg without an explicit reason for doing so. Cyborgs are expensive pieces of NanoTrasen equipment, and you may be punished for detonating them without reason.

			<h3>Detective Work</h3>

			Between your bouts of self-narration, and drinking whiskey on the rocks, you might get a case or two to solve.<br>
			To have the best chance to solve your case, follow these directions:
			<p>
			<ol>
			<li>Go to the crime scene. </li>
			<li>Take your scanner and scan EVERYTHING (Yes, the doors, the tables, even the dog.) </li>
			<li>Once you are reasonably certain you have every scrap of evidence you can use, find all possible entry points and scan them, too. </li>
			<li>Return to your office. </li>
			<li>Using your forensic scanning computer, scan your Scanner to upload all of your evidence into the database.</li>
			<li>Browse through the resulting dossiers, looking for the one that either has the most complete set of prints, or the most suspicious items handled. </li>
			<li>If you have 80% or more of the print (The print is displayed) go to step 10, otherwise continue to step 8.</li>
			<li>Look for clues from the suit fibres you found on your perp, and go about looking for more evidence with this new information, scanning as you go. </li>
			<li>Try to get a fingerprint card of your perp, as if used in the computer, the prints will be completed on their dossier.</li>
			<li>Assuming you have enough of a print to see it, grab the biggest complete piece of the print and search the security records for it. </li>
			<li>Since you now have both your dossier and the name of the person, print both out as evidence, and get security to nab your baddie.</li>
			<li>Give yourself a pat on the back and a bottle of the ships finest vodka, you did it!. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			It really is that easy! Good luck!
