//how to place label:
//1: set label in labeller
//2: pick up label object
//3: click on label with the hand the label is in
//4: place label on something
//how to remove label
//1: use labeller on item
//2: select label to remove (if there is >1 label anyway, if there is only one it will just remove that one)
