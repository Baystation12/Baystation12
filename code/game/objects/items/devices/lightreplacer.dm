
// Light Replacer (LR)
//
// ABOUT THE DEVICE
//
// This is a device supposedly to be used by Janitors and Janitor Cyborgs which will
// allow them to easily replace lights. This was mostly designed for Janitor Cyborgs since
// they don't have hands or a way to replace lightbulbs.
//
// HOW IT WORKS
//
// You attack a light fixture with it, if the light fixture is broken it will replace the
// light fixture with a working light; the broken light is then placed on the floor for the
// user to then pickup with a trash bag. If it's empty then it will just place a light in the fixture.
//
// HOW TO REFILL THE DEVICE
//
// It will need to be manually refilled with lights.
// If it's part of a robot module, it will charge when the Robot is inside a Recharge Station.
//
// EMAGGED FEATURES
//
// NOTICE: The Cyborg cannot use the emagged Light Replacer and the light's explosion was nerfed. It cannot create holes in the station anymore.
//
// I'm not sure everyone will react the emag's features so please say what your opinions are of it.
//
// When emagged it will rig every light it replaces, which will explode when the light is on.
// This is VERY noticable, even the device's name changes when you emag it so if anyone
// examines you when you're holding it in your hand, you will be discovered.
// It will also be very obvious who is setting all these lights off, since only Janitor Borgs and Janitors have easy
// access to them, and only one of them can emag their device.
//
// The explosion cannot insta-kill anyone with 30% or more health.
