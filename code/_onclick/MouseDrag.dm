 * Called by `/mob/proc/OnMouseDrag()` when a mob within this atom's contents performs a mouse drag operation. Used to provide alternative handling to mouse dragging within certain atoms.
 *
 * **Parameters**:
 * - `src_object` - The atom being dragged.
 * - `over_object` - The atom under the mouse pointer.
 * - `src_location` - The turf, stat panel, grid cell, etc from where `src_object` was dragged.
 * - `over_location` - The turf, stat panel, grid cell, etc. containing the object under the mouse pointer.
 * - `src_control` - The id of the skin control the object was dragged from
 * - `over_control` - The id of the skin control the object was dragged over
 * - `params` - Click and keyboard parameters.
 * - `user` - The mob performing the mouse drag operation.
 *
 * Returns boolean. TRUE if the mouse drag operation was intercepted, FALSE otherwise.
