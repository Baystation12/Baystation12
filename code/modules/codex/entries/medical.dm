	requires a supply of pure oxygen, provided by canisters that are attached. The most commonly used chemicals in the chambers are Cryoxadone and \
	Clonexadone. Clonexadone is more effective in treating all damage, including Genetic damage, but is otherwise functionally identical.<br>\

	Activating the freezer nearby, and setting it to a temperature setting below 150, is recommended before operation! Further, any clothing the patient \
