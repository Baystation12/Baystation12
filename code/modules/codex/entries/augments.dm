\
	<p>To use:</p>\
	<ol>\
	<li>Optional: Use a screwdriver on the Autodoc to configure the augment's installation location, if applicable.\
	<li>Firmly buckle yourself to a solid object such as a bed or chair.\
	<li>Ensure that you are firmly secured, then activate the Autodoc in your hand.\
	<li>The Autodoc will perform a rapid surgical procedure on you. Be as still as possible during this time - it will deactivate if it is interrupted.\
	<li>When the operation is complete, collect the spent Autodoc for disposal.\
	</ol>\
\
	<p>Autodocs don't come with their own painkillers, and like any surgery operation, it will be extremely painful without them. It will do its best to seal the wounds it creates, but in the event of an interruption, you will likely be left with an open surgical incision.</p>\
\
	<p>You can use a crowbar to lever the augment out of the Autodoc, but doing so will render the Autodoc itself permanently useless. This might be useful if you have a collaborator that can safely install the augment in a more desirable way.</p>"

\
	<p>It sees the most use in those with autoimmune disorders, or for people with a naturally weak immune system that typically struggles to fight off infections and disease. It's also popular among boosters and bionic aficionados due to its ability to lessen the body's rejection of new additions to it.</p>\
\
	<p>The body requires some time to 'break in' the augment due to rapid changes in the immune system, typically characterized by sneezing, coughing, fevers, and other symptoms of a minor cold. These side effects fade quickly, from anywhere between a few minutes to a day or two. Once the body has broken in the system, deactivating it will cause similar symptoms, as it has to adapt to the sudden lack of supplements it previously had.</p>"

	<p>These systems are niche, but see use among miners, spacers, and other people that might suddenly find themselves requiring a source of clean, breathable air. The sensation of having your lungs fill without breathing can take some time to get used to, though.</p>"
