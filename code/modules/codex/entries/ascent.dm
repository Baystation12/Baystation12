	lore_text = "The Ascent is a human-hostile alien culture located rimward of the Skrellian \
	territories. Little is known about them, and diplomatic channels do not currently exist. \
	They made themselves known to Humanity by attacking and destroying a science vessel called \
	the SEV Magnus, leading to current state of tension.<br><br> \
	The Skrell appear to have stable diplomatic ties to the Ascent, but are reluctant to use them. \
	They have been referred to several times over the course of Human-Skrell history, \
	usually accidentally or offhandedly, or over channels humans were not expected to have access \
	to. The Skrell as a whole refuse to speak about them, even when asked directly, and generally \
	refer any inquiries to their superiors, who then in turn refer the question to others. What \
	little information that has been extracted from the bureaucratic quagmire of the Qerr-Katish \
	follows:<br><br><li> \
	<ul>They are technologically advanced.</ul> \
	<ul>They are difficult to communicate with.</ul> \
	<ul>They are currently disinterested in humanity.</ul> \
	<ul>They consume their own kind.</ul> \
	</li><br> \
	Specifics are hard to come by and even harder to verify. If you think you have hard evidence or \
	information relating to the Ascent, please contact the Codex offices, Venus orbit, for monetary reward."
	mechanics_text = "The Ascent are a hostile insectoid culture neighboring the Skrell. \
	Until quite recently, humanity knew almost nothing about them, but with the destruction of \
	the SEV Magnus in an Ascent assault, first contact has been more or less achieved. The average \
	Skrell citizen knows that the Ascent are vicious, easily provoked, and stand roughly on par with \
	Skrellian technology."
