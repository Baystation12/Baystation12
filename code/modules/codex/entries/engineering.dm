	After integrity falls to zero percent, it will delaminate, causing a massive explosion, station-wide radiation spikes, and hallucinations. \
	Supermatter reacts badly to oxygen in the atmosphere.  It'll also heat up really quick if it is in vacuum.<br>\
	<br>\
	Supermatter cores are extremely dangerous to be close to, and requires protection to handle properly.  The protection you will need is:<br>\
	Optical meson scanners on your eyes, to prevent hallucinations when looking at the supermatter.<br>\
	Radiation helmet and suit, as the supermatter is radioactive.<br>\
	<br>\
	Touching the supermatter will result in *instant death*, with no corpse left behind!  You can drag the supermatter, but anything else will kill you. \
	It is advised to obtain a genetic backup before trying to drag it."

	cause a period of lag as the explosion is processed by the server, as well as irradiating the entire station and causing hallucinations to happen.  \
	Wearing radiation equipment will protect you from most of the delamination effects sans explosion."

	Power consumption and backup power cell charge can be seen from the interface, further controls (turning a specific channel on, off or automatic, \
	toggling the APC's ability to charge the backup cell, or toggling power for the entire area via master breaker) first requires the interface to be unlocked \
