	interfere with anyone else, except for other drones. They hold a wide array of tools to build, repair, maintain, and clean. \
	They function similarly to other synthetics, in that they require recharging regularly, have laws, and are resilient to many hazards, \
	such as fire, radiation, vacuum, and more. Ghosts can join the round as a maintenance drone by using the appropriate verb in the 'ghost' tab. \
	An inactive drone can be rebooted by swiping an ID card on it with engineering or robotics access, and an active drone can be shut down in the same manner. \
	Maintenance drone presence can be requested to specific areas from any maintenance drone control console."
