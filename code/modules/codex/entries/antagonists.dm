	antag_text = "<p>Changelings are intelligent alien creatures with a unique biology that allows them to morph into most organic lifeforms. They are solitary hunters, and have existed for an unknown length of time among the galaxy's civilized races. It is, ultimately, a creature of stealth - hiding behind the faces of its victims, lurking on distant backwaters and long-haul spaceships, waiting for their chance to strike.</p>\
	\
	<h2>Notes</h2>\
	\
	<p>As a changeling, you have almost certainly killed a crewmember and replaced them in order to conceal yourself aboard the ship. You've had time to familiarize yourself with the ins and outs of their identity.</p>\
	\
	<p>General knowledge of changelings is nonexistent. No government or institution has any public knowledge about changelings' existence, and the number of changelings in human space, impersonating humans themselves, is unknown. This gives you a lot of leniency in determining where you came from and why you're aboard the ship, so don't be afraid to get creative.</p>\
	\
	<p>When a changeling consumes a victim, it does so by using a proboscis to 'absorb' them, draining their body of fluids and leaving behind a shriveled, mummified husk. In doing so, the changeling is able to assimilate their victim's thoughts, recent memories, and more importantly, their entire genetic sequence. When it transforms, a changeling literally becomes the person it's imitiating - down to their very DNA.</p>\
	\
	<h2>Mindset</h2>\
	\
	<p>Your true personality, whatever it may be, is likely very alien to other species, unless you are very charismatic in presenting it. Composed of the memories and identities of multiple individuals, you are a collective mind, and as such, you use plural pronouns during internal monologue ('we', 'ours', and so on.)</p>\
	\
	<p>The way you value other sapient life may range from curiosity to simply viewing them as prey. At the least, you likely view them as very primitive, like a spacefaring civilization might see a tribe. If you strive to protect sapient life, it is very unlikely to be out of genuine goodwill as much as it is wanting to keep livestock alive to cull them later.</p>\
	\
	<p>Changelings are solitary. They are naturally suspicious of one another, and often reluctant to cooperate or even communicate - they are fully capable of absorbing one another, and when they do so, they reap far more benefit than consuming normal people. Changelings in a local area may deign to communicate through one another through local airwaves if they choose to, but every friend is a potential foe; every alliance is a double-cross waiting to happen. In the presence of one another, changelings never let their guard down.</p>\
	\
	<h2>Misc.</h2>\
	<p>When you transform into a member of a different species, you maintain your own mindset and thoughts. You don't adapt the personality of whoever it was that you're imitating (even if it may influence your behaviour), and you aren't beholden to any of the trappings of the way their brains work. Impersonation comes naturally to you as a changeling, and you are experienced with adopting and shedding bodies and personalities on a whim as it suits your needs.</p>"
