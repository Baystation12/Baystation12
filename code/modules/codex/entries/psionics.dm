	an upward-facing radio telescope dish, usually printed in green. They perform niche research on behalf \
	of private parties, the SGC, and their own interests. They are also the single largest psionic registration \
	and oversight body in human space, responsible for educating and training operants at no cost, even across \
	territorial and political lines. \

	nullglass weapons that can disrupt or destroy psi-powers, and have their own moderately powerful \
	psionic abilities. They make heavy use of psionic influence to cloud and disrupt efforts at \
	researching or understanding them, and the depth and nature of their connections to political \

	to deep, uninhabited space. A tiny, tiny subset of people exposed to such conditions can develop the \
	ability to perform small feats like levitating coins or removing a headache with nothing but their mind. \
	A decade of study has resulted in the SCG determining that these psionics, mild as they are, don't pose \
	an operational or health risk, but they do encourage operants to register with a psionic regulation body \
	like the Cuchulain Foundation. \

	However, psionics-enhancing implants, drugs and procedures are illegal in most human space, and \
	statistically seem to end in death for those foolish enough to make use of them. Being caught with a \
	cerebroenergetic enhancer, or the drug Three Eye, will net you a hefty prison sentence."
