//////////////
// HOLIDAYS //
//////////////
//Uncommenting ALLOW_HOLIDAYS in config.txt will enable holidays

//It's easy to add stuff. Just modify getHoliday to set holiday to something using the switch for DD(#day) MM(#month) YY(#year).
//You can then check if it's a special day in any code in the game by doing if(events.holiday == "MyHolidayID")

//You can also make holiday random events easily thanks to Pete/Gia's system.
//simply make a random event normally, then assign it a holidayID string which matches the one you gave it in getHolday.
//Anything with a holidayID, which does not match the holiday string, will never occur.

//Please, Don't spam stuff up with stupid stuff (key example being april-fools Pooh/ERP/etc),
//And don't forget: CHECK YOUR CODE!!!! We don't want any zero-day bugs which happen only on holidays and never get found/fixed!
