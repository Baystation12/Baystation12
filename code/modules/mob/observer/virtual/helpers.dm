/*
* These calls could easily be setup to be a bunch of call()() with relevant procs and predicates but performance is a concern.
* BYOND is also a bit inflexible, as some predicates are of the sort /proc/name(host), others host.proc_name(), and some even do host.proc_name(parameter).
* Nothing that cannot be worked around, but it'd be a little messy. I miss C# lambdas...
*
* It would also be possible to acquire virtual mobs in a separate call but that would result in multiple loops,
*  ,even if the virtual mob loop is presumably much smaller than, for example, a range() one,
*	again resulting in performance loss.
