That means you ought to protect ordinary crew members, wizards, traitors, aliens, changelings, Syndicate Operatives and others from killing each other. <b><font color=red>Do no harm! Jirachi can't stand pain or suffering of any living creature. Try to use your offensive abilities as little as possible</font></b> In short - you are adorable but very powerful creature, which loves everybody. Also remember, that fire is best friend for you(and the worst enemy for the most other creatures). Being on fire is the other than Hybernation method to pretty rapidly regenerate your health and energy.
