    desc_amateur = "You know the basics of programming, but you're not very good at it and couldn't do it professionally. You have a pretty good idea of what makes AIs tick. You understand how information is stored in a computer, and you can fix simple computer problems. You're computer-literate, but you still make mistakes. If you tried to subvert the AI, you might make mistakes in wording your new laws."
    desc_trained = "At this level, you're probably working with computers on a daily basis. You understand and can repair the telecommunications network. Your understanding of AI programming and psychology lets you fix problems with the AIs or cyborgs--or create problems, if you so desire. You can program computers and AIs and change their laws effectively."
    desc_professional = "People are probably starting to wonder whether you might be a computer yourself. Computer code is your first language; you relate to AIs as easily as (probably more easily than) organics. You could build a telecommunications network from the ground up."

You can use an autoinjector designed for civilian use, probably by reading the directions printed on it. You can tell when someone is badly hurt and needs a doctor; you can see whether someone has a badly broken bone, is having trouble breathing, or is unconscious. You may not be able to tell the difference between unconscious and dead."
    desc_amateur = "You've taken a first-aid training, nursing, or EMT course. You can stop bleeding, do CPR, apply a splint, take someone's pulse, apply trauma and burn treatments, and read a handheld health scanner. You probably know that Dylovene helps poisoning and Dexalin helps people with breathing problems; you can use a syringe or start an IV. You've been briefed on the symptoms of common emergencies like a punctured lung, appendicitis, alcohol poisoning, or broken bones, and though you can't treat them, you know that they need a doctor's attention. You can recognize most emergencies as emergencies and safely stabilize and transport a patient."
    desc_trained = "You are an experienced EMT or experienced nurse, a medical resident, or a doctor. You know how to treat most illnesses and injuries, though exotic illnesses and unusual injuries may still stump you. You have probably begun to specialize in some sub-field of medicine. In emergencies, you can think fast enough to keep your patients alive, and even when you can't treat a patient, you know how to find someone who can. You probably have some skill in genetics, virology, and surgery, if only to the extent of being able to create an antibody, do a cloning scan, or assist a surgeon in the operating room. You can use a full-body scanner, and you know something's off about a patient with an alien parasite or cortical borer."
    desc_professional = "You are an experienced doctor. You've seen almost everything there is to see when it comes to injuries and illness and even when it comes to something you haven't seen, you can apply your wide knowledge base to put together a treatment.

    desc_amateur = "You've taken an anatomy class and you've spent at least some time poking around inside actual people. You know where everything is, more or less. You could assist in surgery, if you have the required medical skills. If you have the forensics knowledge, you could perform an autopsy. If you really had to, you could probably perform basic surgery such as an appendectomy, but you're not yet a qualified surgeon and you really shouldn't--not unless it's an emergency. If you're a xenobiologist, you know how to take out slime cores."
    desc_trained = "You're a surgical resident, or an experienced medical doctor. You can put together broken bones, fix a damaged lung, patch up a liver, or remove an appendix without problems. But tricky surgeries, with an unstable patient or delicate manipulation of vital organs like the heart and brain, are at the edge of your ability, and you prefer to leave them to specialized surgeons. You can recognize when someone's anatomy is noticeably unusual. You're trained in working with several species, but you're probably better at surgery on your own species."
    desc_professional = "You are an experienced surgeon. You can handle anything that gets rolled, pushed, or dragged into the OR, and you can keep a patient alive and stable even if there's no one to assist you. You can handle severe trauma cases or multiple organ failure, repair brain damage, and perform heart surgery. By now, you've probably specialized in one field, where you may have made new contributions to surgical technique. You can detect even small variations in the anatomy of a patient--even a changeling probably wouldn't slip by your notice, provided you could get one on the operating table."

You know the principles of quarantine and you know how to keep a virus from spreading. You know that spaceacillin will help the body fight off a virus. However, you're not specialized in virology, and you probably don't have a whole lot of experience in dealing with viruses. If you are a medical doctor, you know how to treat symptoms and keep sick patients stable."
    desc_trained = "You know how to analyze, modify, and cure viruses, and could probably do so even without most of the equipment in the virology lab. You know how to trigger mutations in a virus and how to isolate genes. If you really wanted to, you could create a deadly virus, provided you got lucky with the mutations."
    desc_professional = "You are a specialized virologist - either a medical doctor or a scientific researcher. You may be well-known in the field, having published in prestigious journals; or you may be a mad scientist working away in secret. You know how to use a virus as a tool or a weapon. You can cure any epidemic and if you wanted to, you could start one so deadly and contagious that your targets wouldn't know what hit them."
