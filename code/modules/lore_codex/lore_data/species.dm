	the Terran Commonwealth, or the [quick_link("Terran Confederacy")]. [quick_link("TSC")]s push Humanity into further reaches of space, and are at the bleeding edge of new \
	technology. In recent days, the discovery of the phoron giant in Nyx have fueled investments and jobs, bringing many Humans to the outer rim of their controlled systems, \

	Humanity). They are at the top of Galactic prowess, with them being the firsrt Empire Humanity ever met in the stars. They are responsible for many advancements that Humanity \

	Minoris primary being ringed with a cloud of singing space-station-sized entities.\

	The Dionaea coexist peacefully with all known species, especially the [quick_link("Skrell")]. Their communal mind makes them slow to react, and they have difficulty understanding even the \

	the low, low price of twenty thalers. Its unfortunate, but you can’t put much stock into Vox history. It is in a constant state of flux, changing at will to suit a crafty Vox \

	are a scourge on the Universe, and they are there to destroy them or enslave them. Eugenics is probably the best thing ever to them. They also have a subspecies that has been \
	genetically engineered into slavery. They breath Chlorine, and they hate everyone."
