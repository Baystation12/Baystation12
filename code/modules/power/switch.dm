//This is a power switch. When turned on it looks at the cables around the tile that it's on and notes which cables are trying to connect to it.
//After it knows this it creates the number of cables from the center to each of the cables attempting to conenct. These cables cannot be removed
//with wirecutters. When the switch is turned off it removes all the cables on the tile it's on.
//The switch uses a 5s delay to prevent powernet change spamming.
