	description = "The diona home system is a trinary system, first discovered by the Skrell and later revisted by a mining \
	consortium. It has no planets and no settled large bodies, but sports a massive debris ring composed of ancient habitats \
	and destroyed stations. The dionaea themselves were found in scattered orbits around each of the three stars, singing to \
	each other across the inky void."
