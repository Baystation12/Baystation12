	description = "Tau-Wilo is a small planet and the origin of all serpentids. It has low gravity and a dense oxygen \
	nitrogen atmosphere with a tinge of phoron. It is dominated by biodiverse tropical and subtropical forests, with \
	few areas of planes. The only human settlement is a research facility built by Xynergy and used as a part of their \
	giant armoured serpentid training program. Tau-Wilo is the only known location for breeding populations of giant \
	armoured serpentids, and is the shared homeland of every individual of that race."
