	across the globe. Huge, planned cities consisting of numerous arcologies with a focus on eco-friendliness. No longer the political power of \
	Humanity, Earth has been somewhat unfriendly to the government since the beginning of the SCG. Most Earthers are taught that they are the true humans \
	unlike the Martians and Lunarians who are descended from those rich enough to escape the early days of climate change.\
	<br><br>People from Earth are among the wealthier humans on average, largely due to Earth's revival as a major food provider, and one of the few places in the SCG \
	that can provide genuine organic fruits, vegetables, and meat. From a variety of ancient cultures, the people of Earth are as diverse as they have always been."

	deep within the undercities, built into ancient caves and lava tubes.  <br><br> Terraforming on Mars was never able to turn the world fully green. \
	Much of the surface remains inhospitable.  However, under the domes, it is a vastly different story.  Countless green spaces and agri-zones have been \
	established.  Though Mars cannot feed itself, it can produce enough oxygen and water to keep its domes self-sufficient.  Mars is a planet of diversity and history, \
	much of it dating back to the former nation states of Earth.  As such, Mars is disunited into a collection of semi-independent City States, overseen by the United Nations of Mars. \
	Social Welfare, Economic Class, and Culture differs widely from state to state, from the cosmopolitan urbanites of the Olympus Megalopolis, to the friendly and kind-hearted Delphins,\
	to the reclusive and socially isolated Aresians.  They all share a strong sense of pride in their homeworld.<br><br> Mars has not had an easy past, but has fought to become the \
