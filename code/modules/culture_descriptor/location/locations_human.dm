	Since the founding of the first colony by Jimmy Gideon many years ago Mars has been an important player on the Human stage. Terraforming on \
	Mars was only partially successful, and today much of the population lives either in huge domed cities/agri-zones or within a vast underground \
	tunnel network connecting large underground cities. Often seen as the primary divide on the planet, the rich surfaces versus the poor \
	tunnellers, Mars is rife with dissent, crime and continuous unrest, especially underground.<br><br>The people of Mars vary, from the poor, \
	downtrodden tunnellers to the cosmopolitan urbanites of Olympus to the hardy farmers of the agri-domes, though they all share a strong sense \
	of Martian pride. The Martian people have not had an easy history. As the new, primary home of humanity the people have seen great struggles \
	over the centuries, ranging from revolutions to political upheaval and regular rioting. The people of Mars consider themselves somewhat tougher \
	than most with a fierce pride that often clashes not just with those from other planets, but those from other parts of Mars."

	Despite its status, Luna is not without its own issues, though much of the population \

	'old money' of humanity, with many of them having distinct, traceable lineages to the first settlers, old Earth dynasties and heavy corporate \
