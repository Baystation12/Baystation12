	a stable planetary culture the far-flung nomadic species has. Arkborn vox can expect to enjoy long lives, infrequent \
	re-embodiment, and a rich and varied social life amongst the rambunctious ark clans and families. Raiders and salvagers \
	may look upon the arkborn as lazy and passive, but they tend to return to them for rest and recuperation after each \

	name = HOME_SYSTEM_VOX_SHROUD
	description = "The shroud of an arkship is an unstable and dangerous place to live, and those vox stationed there are \
	often salvagers, scavengers, engineers and technicians, struggling with the endless burden of keeping the decay of the ark \
	from progressing beyond the shroud and into more critical systems. By comparison to arkborn, they are quiet, self-supporting and \
	independant, with few cares for clan politics, family squabbles, or contest challenges. They know their task is critical to \
	the survival of the vox as a species, and next to that, tussling with your peers seems a bit immature."

	name = HOME_SYSTEM_VOX_SHIP
	description = "Shipborn vox are often purpose-grown for their assigned tasks, frequently under the direct supervision of \
	an apex or their servants. They are often seen as 'disposable' in vox culture, as they rarely survive their incarnation \
	beyond the tour of the vessel. Those that do, however, are generally thrown straight back into long-distance shipside \
	duties, as their success shows their masters that they are well suited to it. The life of a shipborn vox is arduous and \
	bloody, and they will be killed and reborn more often than even the most reckless of arkborn raiders."
