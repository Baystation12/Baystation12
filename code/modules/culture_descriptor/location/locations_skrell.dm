		an archipelago filled ocean. The smaller continent, and original home of the Skrell civilisation, Qorr'gloa, is mostly swampland, with most cities being \
		built on the coast. It is separated by the Qo'rria Sea from the other, larger continent, Xi'Krri'oal, which is more populous and varied, with snowy \
		mountains in the south to temperate zones in the inner areas. Composed of hundreds of city-states, Qerr'Balak is still home to a sizable population of Skrell. \
		While no longer the sole powerhouse of the Skrell civilisation, it is still widely respected among skrellkind as their homeworld, and for its academic and \
		scientific prowess."

	Established some 500 years ago Talamira is considered a trade and commerce hub in its sector. This is largely a result of its central position between a large \
	number of established frontier city-states and the rest of Skrell space, The planet itself consists of a single swamp ridden supercontinent that is mildly \
	warmer than Qerr'Balak, with hundreds of city-states dotting the surface, most of which are heavily invested in manufacturing and logistics, benefiting from the \
	trade of raw resources with frontier worlds.This rising star of the Skrell territories is considered an economic powerhouse, with its city states wielding influence \

	The Skrell of Roa'Sora have been engaged in a state of constant defence against a nearby species that has made no diplomatic attempts to communicate known \
	only as the 'Throom,' a name given because of a distinctive sound made by their vessels. The species, which appear to do little other than raid, make regular incursions.\
	It is because of this state that Roa'Sora is heavily militarised in nature, with a heavy Raskinta influence and strong cooperation with its SDTF, Sora'terr.\
	The primary export of the planet is rare minerals, though it possesses a strong military defence industry also. In spite of their situation the city-state regularly \
	attempts to negotiate and open diplomatic channels with their assailants to little avail.Geographically, the planet is fairly mountainous and rocky, with a few deep lakes \
	in mountain valleys, around which most mining stations are built."

	humanity, and it is here that a number of skrellian corporations offer loan services of skilled Skrell to human organizations. Many inner-system city states use their \
	counterparts and their corporations as an intermediary to trade with humanity while remaining obscure. Despite the planet's prosperity there is a growing conservative \
