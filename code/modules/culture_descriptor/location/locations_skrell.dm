	description = "Qerr'Balak, in the Qerr'Valis system, is the ancient home of skrellkind. A large, swampy world, it consists of two continents separated by \
		an archipelago filled ocean. The smaller continent, and original home of the Skrell civilisation, Qorr'gloa, is mostly swampland, with most cities being \
		built on the coast. It is separated by the Qo'rria Sea from the other, larger continent, Xi'Krri'oal, which is more populous and varied, with snowy \
		mountains in the south to temperate zones in the inner areas. Composed of hundreds of city-states, Qerr'Balak is still home to a sizable population of Skrell. \
		While no longer the sole powerhouse of the Skrell civilisation, it is still widely respected among skrellkind as their homeworld, and for its academic and \
		scientific prowess."
