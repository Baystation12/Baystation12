planet of Ouere has seen many clans and small groups stepping through it into this new world. There is \
no clear consensus on how to treat this new world - either as a logical extention of Moghes, a completely new entity, \
or simply as a resource base for improving the home planet. Many colonists, artifact hunters and ostracised groups have \
flocked to the planet, with Followers of Markesh communities growing quite rapidly in numbers compared to other parts of Moghes. "
