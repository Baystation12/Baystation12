	description = "The creators of the adherents once resided on a gleaming gas giant called Canon. After the solar flare called the Scream, \
		nothing moves in the ocean of cloud other than the artificial weapon platforms and automated defences that enforce the eternal quarantine \
		of the dead planet. To the Vigil, Canon is a shrine to their lost gods, untouchable and revered. Adherents stationed around Canon work \
		directly under Core Traffic Control, carrying out tasks vital to the continued functioning of the Vigil as a whole. They are likely highly \
		loyal and very traditionalist by comparison to their peers."

	name = HOME_SYSTEM_ADHERENT_MOURNER
	description = "In their unending search across the stars, the Vigil has uncovered many so-called grave worlds or monument worlds - planets \
		upon which a sentient species met an unkind end. The adherents build orbital stations over such worlds to add them to their vigil, watching \
		over the bombed-out, desolate or virally rampant surfaces in memoriam for those who died there. Adherents stationed at the observation \
		stations over the monument worlds tend to be more reflective and less garrulous than their peers. They have stood silent vigil over the \
		grave of a billion souls for longer than humans have had electricity, and that colours their instinctive deference to organic intelligences \
		somewhat."
