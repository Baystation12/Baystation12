	description = "The arkships, vast as they are, could not survive without the ceaseless efforts of the salvage crews \
	that strip-mine asteroids, stations and ships for the raw materials needed to keep things together. Although it is a \
	much less lethal pursuit than being a raider, salvagers have a dangerous job and often do not make it back to the ark \
	in one piece."

	description = "Amongst the vox, the prestige of being a raider is second only to working directly for an apex. They are \
	the cutting talon of the vox and the dashing, charismatic figures of adventure that serve as examples for fresh hatchlings \
	and ambitious labourers. Many raiders end up in positions of authority and power amid the ramshackle social structures of \
	the arkships, though as always they remain under the authority of the local apex."
