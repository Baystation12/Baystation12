	description = "Giant armoured serpentids are born and raised on their home planet, and live in colonies of between around 30 and 120 \
	members. They don't like being physically close to others, and don't regularly make physical contact with others. The giant armoured \
	serpentids found in the workforce have gone through a training program run by Xynergy. They are assigned a grade based on job level \
	and how well adjusted they are to working with humans."
