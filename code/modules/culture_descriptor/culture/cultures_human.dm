	average level of comfort expected in Sol space. Most surfacers are like many across the galaxy, though a few harbour rivalries with other Martian cultural \

	to the same amenities and services as Surfacers are somewhat poorer than their aboveground brethren as a result of their less desirable locale as well as a strong \
	criminal presence stemming from centuries of poor policing and a focus on the surface by the martian government. Most Tunnellers are resilient, though distrusting \

	of one of the various corporations, persons hired in service roles in one of the many prefectures or a resident of New Vegas. The 'poor' of Luna typically resent the rich because of their \

	Luna's upper class isn't equal; generally divided between new, corporate money and old, dynastic money; many members of the old dynasties look down on the newly wealthy. \

	pot owing to the sheer number of transient workers, hauler crews and government and corporate employees basing themselves around the great shipyards of Ceres. This has led to belter \

	much of the planet's infrastructure being unstable or outright falling apart. This, coupled with rampant corruption and the large influence of criminal organisations across much of \
	the planet has led to the people of Pluto having something of a seedy reputation, its citizens being viewed with disrepute. The people themselves, however, are usually \

	countries have at least two arcologies which make up much of the population, with the remaining humans living in small villages or from one of the many nature preserve communes. \
	The long recovery period of Earth has resulted in much of the population being environmentally aware and heavily conservationist, eager to avoid past mistakes. Most Earthers are \

	This has afforded those from the system or planet a reputation as being a cut above the rest in technical matters, with those who attended the Ceti Institute of Technology \

	vital goods, a lonely outpost on the edge of a dreary backwater, such people are raised in small, confined environments with few others, and tend to be most familiar with older, reliable but outdated \
