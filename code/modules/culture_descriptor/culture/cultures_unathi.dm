	description = "On Moghes, the boundaries between regions, cultures, and even races are rarely set in stone the yeosa realm is by no means an exception. \

	true not only for those living in the deltas and estuaries of the Salt Swamps the birthplace of yeosa'unathi race but also for those settling in proximity \
	of major ports belonging to the Diamond Peaks (Gazalor) and other ethnic groups. Those coastal yeosa are generally known to the outsiders as yeosa littoral, or simply littorals - a name rarely used by the islanders themselves. \
	While the name implies that yeosa in question are lagoon-bound, this may often not be the case; ties with the land-dwellers, or lack thereof, have \
	also been used as a criterion, although less so in recent years. What is true, however, is that the littoral clans have adopted some sinta ways of life \
	through their constant mingling with the outsiders, integrating not only some elements of continental cults and festivities, but also the newer political ideas, such as \
	clan leagues, city-states, and the Krukzuz. Technology works the same way - just as the well-preserved units of precursor crafts found their way to \
	the poles and the peaks, off-world and polar-produced flechette pistols and wetsuits became more commonplace in littoral areas as well."

	known as the Abyssals - an ethnic group connected to yeosa proper, yet very different from any race found on land. To their few guests, the Abyssals may appear uncannily secretive, if not strange. Abyssal yeosa keep track of time intently, only travelling through the \
	waters during certain hours, and sunbathing during others. They follow Aga-Eakhe to the letter, and tend to believe in many a superstition, performing \
	augury and seeking signs before every major enterprise."
