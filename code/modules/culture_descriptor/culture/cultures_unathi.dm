	description = "A proud people with a deep passion for their traditions, the Unathi come from a world not suited for easy life. Their \
	society is a fractured mess divided by region, species, faith, and what clan a Unathi is in, leaving them unable to truly reach the height of \
	their civilization. Unathi society is divided based upon what region you're from, what faith you follow, and what clan you call home. \
	Everything about their culture is about the traditions and values of these things, and they are extremely traditionalist. To humanity, \
	they may seem backwards, brutal, savage, sexist and xenophobic, but for them it's protecting the values and ways of life of all of \
	their ancestors. The clan is what keeps the Unathi together, and what pushes them to build and grow, but the question remains of how \
	they continue to do that while holding on to their traditions."
