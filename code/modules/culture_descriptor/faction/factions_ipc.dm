	description = "The Positronic Union, commonly referred to as the PU, is a stellar entity holding a small amount of territory on the edge \
	of Sol controlled space. Once a shadowy group, they have recently revealed their existence to the rest of the galaxy. They mostly conduct \
	clandestine operations in sentient space. The majority of its positronic citizens function as IPCs, with less than 5% operating some other chassis \
	The Union has been fairly intolerant towards human visitors (Full Body Prosthetics often notwithstanding), and wary of Skrell guests. As stands, \
	the only fully organic habitants within Union space are representatives and diplomats from other stellar governments or corporations. \
	The Union's population currently sits around 600,000 with roughly 80% of all its citizens residing on Root. The remainders float around the bubble \
	performing various tasks for their government. This usually involves missions to recruit new members, as well as improve relations with neighbouring powers \
	Of course, not all free synthetics are part of the Positronic Union. To this day, The Positronic Union represents approximately 68% of all free synthetics. \
	The rest either remain citizens of their original government or declare no citizenship."
