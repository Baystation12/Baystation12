	a task the Qerr'Voal has carried out with distinction for 600 years. Despite the relative safety and stability of the system many young Skrell \

	several worlds at the border between the two species this SDTF has, like the colonies it protects, started to slowly adopt some human customs \
	and views, for better and for worse. Still growing today, some expect it to become the largest SDTF along the skrell-human border within the next thirty years."

	frontier colony SDTF's, or functions as an intermediary SDTF for systems where a presence has yet to be established. The Skrell of Yii'Talana \
