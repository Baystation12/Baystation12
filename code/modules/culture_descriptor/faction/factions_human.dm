	description = "The Sol Central Government, commonly referred to as SolGov or the SCG, is a federal republic \
	composed of numerous human member states spanning many systems.\
	Based in the Sol System and with most seats of Government on Olympus, Mars,\
	the SCG governs the majority of human space. Currently engaged in a cold war with the Confederation of Gilgamesh \
	Its primary governing bodies are the Assemblies which are led by an Assembly-elected secretary general. \
	Member states have a great degree of freedom in their actions, though the SCG manages sapient rights, \
	domestic security, economic policy, and diplomacy for humanity as a whole. The SCG's population is diverse \
	including many non-humans (though they are not citizens) and encompassing a wide range of systems, territories \
	habitats, and celestial bodies. However, it is large, cumbersome, divided and slow to respond to issues due to \
	its massive bureaucracy and the distance between worlds. Through its member states, the SCG governs as one of the \
	most advanced and powerful civilisations in the known galaxy."

	The oldest component of the Defence Forces, the Fleet considers itself the pinnacle of Human military accomplishment. \
	It is well funded, but seen as complacent and bloated. It is made up of five Fleets, with missions ranging from \
	diplomatic security for Sol dignitaries, to border patrol along the vast frontier and quick reaction force duties. \
	Any SCG human citizen with at least a secondary school level of education can enlist into the Fleet, going through \
	basic training and on-ship training for their rating (speciality). Commissioned officer candidates require at least a \
	Bachelor degree and go through a lengthy training process before being assigned to a warship. \

	directors, made up of corporate representatives and members of Expeditionary Corps command and the Committee for the Economy. \
	While on the surface the Expeditionary Corps Organisation appears to have noble goals, it is in reality a compromise between the noble ideals of pioneering \
	science, and the corporate desire to make a quick buck off whatever is found. Rumours also abound about shady practices, hidden \
	protocols, and xenoartifacts being 'lost' in transit, but nothing has been conclusively proven as of yet, and SCG doubtless is \
	reluctant to harpoon their own project."
