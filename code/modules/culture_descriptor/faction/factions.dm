	Based in the Sol System and with most seats of Government on Olympus, Mars,\
	the SCG governs the majority of human space. Currently engaged in a Cold War with the Terran Colonial Confederation \
	Its primary governing bodies are the Assemblies which are led by an Assembly-elected secretary general. \
	Member states have a great degree of freedom in their actions, though the SCG manages sapient rights, \
	domestic security, economic policy, and diplomacy for humanity as a whole. The SCG's population is diverse \
	including many non-humans (though they are not citizens) and encompassing a wide range of systems, territories \
	habitats, and celestial bodies. However, it is large, cumbersome, divided and slow to respond to issues due to \
	its massive bureaucracy and the distance between worlds. Through its member states, the SCG governs as one of the \
	most advanced and powerful civilisations in the known galaxy."

	The oldest component of the Defence Forces, the Fleet considers itself the pinnacle of Human military accomplishment. \
	It is well funded, but seen as complacent and bloated. Until recently the Fleet have not had a serious enemy to deal with, \

	Increasingly anti non-human, the TCC is in a cold war with the Sol Central Government following  the Gaia Conflict, a large \
	scale conflict between the SCG and TCC that saw a great deal of death and destruction. In Sol space \"Terrans\" as they are known are \
	heavily mistrusted and in some instances, met with downright hostility. Today the TCC continues to be an economic powerhouse following \
	a period of steady economic recovery, with most of its exports being manufactured goods, primarily armaments."

	It consists of uniformed personnel (enlisted and commissioned officers) and corporate contractors hired on a per mission basis. \
	The primary purpose of the Expeditionary Corps is the exploration of uncharted space and worlds, mineralogy surveys and \
	Xenoarchaeological studies and, most importantly, the discovery of new alien life. The Expeditionary Corps is \
	often considered a motivated, starry-eyed organisation that genuinely strives to be the best it can."
