	The Hegemony's formal purpose is the promotion of unathi interests in trade and diplomacy with other species. In practice, this has often resulted \
	in the reinforcement of city-states in the emerging market of off-world commerce."

	description = "Established in 2257 by a group of prominent Diamond Peak Kaahnepos, the Ssen-Uuma Convent seeks to ensure the preservation of the \
	established order, well-being, and independence of Moghes. This is done by protecting it from harmful influence and possible aggression of more \
	developed alien races. Essentially a military alliance between major clans of the area, administered by a strictly ranked General Staff. Ssen-Uuma \
	gathers military and political intelligence on alien empires, purchases modern equipment and supports unathi mercenaries operating off Moghes. \

	description = "The most powerful Krukzuz in the Diamond Peaks, the Gresis clan is the embodiment of the Diamond Peaks' culture. Having made vassals of \
	various clans, their strength is nearly uncontested in the area. Xenophobic, they see off-world mining as a threat to the area they call home and have \
	numerous attacks to drive them out of the area. Offworlders are careful to not step into territory that is controlled by the Gresis clan, less they risk \
	less the risk attack from them and their vassals."

	description = "The most prominent yeosa faction, the Rah'Zakeh league's duties primarily focus on the yeosa and upholding the Aga-Eakhe. This includes \
	a judicial body that handles piracy, tomb raiding, smuggling, etc. They resolve religious disputes and keep records of claims as well as \
	function as arbiters. This is only a small fraction of their duties, with over two hundred yeosa'unathi shamans that handle smaller matters. \

	description = "The Tersten Hegemony was formed as a result of the clans that have taken residence on Tersten. Its primary focus, much like the Moghes Hegemony, \
	is to promote unathi interests in trade and diplomacy. However, most if not all clans that have settled on Tersten have joined the Hegemony with their \
	kaahnepos seated as members of the council. The Tersten Hegemony enjoys a great deal of peace with the Tersten people. Most issues between the clans \
	and the Tersten government are handled through the Hegemony, acting in the interests of maintaining their relationship with Tersten."
