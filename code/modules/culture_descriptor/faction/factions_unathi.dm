	developed alien races. Essentially a military alliance between major clans of the area, administered by a strictly ranked General Staff. Ssen-Uuma \

	numerous attacks to drive them out of the area. Offworlders are careful to not step into territory that is controlled by the Gresis clan, less they risk \
	less the risk attack from them and their vassals."
