	For Kharmaani, this is oriented around individual gynes and their power structures. Monarch Serpentids have a slightly less \
	manipulative approach, as well as more numerous and less self-absorbed queens. They tend to cluster in broad social groups, \
	usually within the designated oxygen-rich 'mezzanines' each fortress-nest happily allocates to them. As mild as they are by \
	comparison to their fellows, Monarch Serpentid political and social culture is still factional and often vicious."

	description = "The life of an alate is a difficult and frequently short one. Those who survive \
	to maturity have had the violent and uncompromising culture of the Ascent beaten into them with \
	bladed forelimbs for their entire lives. There is no formal schooling within the Kharmaani \
	populations of the Ascent, as alates are so numerous and short-lived that it is something of a \
	waste of resources. However, as they mature, a smart and capable alate will amass an education \
	in practical and theoretical disciplines like piloting, engineering, farming or any number of \
	fields. A particularly lucky (or non-lethally gelded) alate can aspire to a position within the \
	retinue of their mother-gyne, where they will receive directed specialist training and an \
	important role under the careful supervision of the gyne's AI control minds."

	description = "By the time a gyne has survived her 'childhood' and shed the exoskeleton of an \
	alate during a breeding frenzy, she has obtained a master class education in murdering and eating \
	her rivals at the first opportunity, as well as a sideline in a technical or practical field. The \
	rapid growth of her body and brain, and the responsibilities of her position, require every gyne to \
	supplement this with intensive training in management, logistics, military command, sociology, politics \
	and any number of the other critical fields tied into managing a fortress-nest of tens of thousands of \
	individual citizens."
