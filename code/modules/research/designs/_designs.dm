/*
For the materials datum, it assumes you need reagents unless specified otherwise. To designate a material that isn't a reagent,
you use one of the material IDs below. These are NOT ids in the usual sense (they aren't defined in the object or part of a datum),
they are simply references used as part of a "has materials?" type proc. They all start with a  to denote that they aren't reagents.
The currently supporting non-reagent materials:

Don't add new keyword/IDs if they are made from an existing one (such as rods which are made from metal). Only add raw materials.

Design Guidlines
- When adding new designs, check rdreadme.dm to see what kind of things have already been made and where new stuff is needed.
- A single sheet of anything is 2000 units of material. Materials besides metal/glass require help from other jobs (mining for
other types of metals and chemistry for reagents).
