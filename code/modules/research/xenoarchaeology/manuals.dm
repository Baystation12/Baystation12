				<h1><a name="Prep">Prepping the expedition</a></h1>
				Every digsite I've been to, someone has forgotten something and I've never yet been to a dig that hasn't had me hiking to get to it - so gather your gear
				and get it to the site the first time. You learn quick that time is money, when you've got a shipful of bandits searching for you the next valley over,
				but don't be afraid to clear some space if there are any inconvenient boulders in the way.<br>
				<list>
				<li>Floodlights (if it's dark)</li>
				<li>Wooden trestle tables (for holding tools and finds)</li>
				<li>Suspension field generator</li>
				<li>Load bearing servitors (such as a mulebot, or hover-tray)</li>
				<li>Spare energy packs</li>

				<h1><a name="Tools">Knowing your tools</a></h1>
				Every archaeologist has a plethora of tools at their disposal, but here's the important ones:<br>
				<list>
				<li><b>Picks, pickaxes and brushes</b> - don't underestimate the the smallest or largest in your arsenal, each one clears a different amount
					of the rockface so each one has a use.</li>
				<li><b>Measuring tape</b> - don't leave home without it, you can use it to measure the depth a rock face has been excavated to.</li>
				<li><b>GPS locater</b> - knowing where you are is the first step to not be lost.</li>
				<li><b>Core sampler</b> - use this to take core samples from rock faces, which you can then run to the lab for analysis.</li>
				<li><b>Depth scanner</b> - uses x-ray diffraction to locate anomalous densities in rock, indicating archaeological deposits or mineral veins.
					Comes with a handy reference log containing co-ordinates and time of each scan.</li>
				<li><b>Alden-Saraspova counter</b> - uses a patented application of Fourier Transform analysis to determine the difference between background and
					exotic radiation. Use it to determine how far you are from anomalous energy sources.</li>
				<li><b>Radio beacon locater</b> - leave a beacon at an item of interest, then track it down later with this handy gadget. Watch for interference from other
					devices though.</li>
				<li><b>Flashlight or portable light source</b> - Self explanatory, I hope.</li>
				<li><b>Environmental safety gear</b> - This one's dependant on the environment you're working in, but enclosed footwear and pack of internals
					could save your life.</li>
				<li><b>Anomaly safety gear</b> - A biosealed and catalysis-resistant suit along with eye shielding, tinted hood and non-reactive disposable gloves are
				the best kind of protection you can hope for from the errors our forbears may have unleashed.</li>
				<li><b>Personal defence weapon</b> - Never know what you'll find on the dig: pirates, natives, ancient guardians, carnivorous wildlife...
					it pays in blood to be prepared.</li>
				</list><br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Find">Finding the dig</a></h1>
				Wouldn't be an archaeologist without their dig, but everyone has to start somewhere. Here's a basic procedure I go through when cataloguing a new planet:<br>
				<list>
				<li><b>Get in touch with the locals</b> (in particular geologists, miners and farmers) - Never know what's been turned up by accident, then left to
					gather dust on a shelf.</li>
				<li><b>Check the obvious areas first</b> - even if you're pressed for time, these ones are the generally easiest to search, and the most likely targets
					of your rivals.</li>
				<li><b>Do some prospecting</b> - the earth mother isn't in the habit of displaying her secrets to the world (although sometimes you get lucky).
					Drop a shaft and clear away a bit of surface rock here and there, you never know what might be lurking below the surface.</li>
				<li><b>Tips on unearthing a deposit</b> - How do you know when you're golden? Look for telltale white strata that looks strange or out of place, or if
					something has broken under your pick while you're digging. Your depth scanner is your best friend, but even it can't distinguish between
					ordinary minerals and ancient leavings, if in doubt then err on the side of caution.</li>
				</list><br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Analyse">Analysing the contents of a dig</a></h1>
				You've found some unusual strata, but it's not all peaches from here. No archaeologist ever managed to pull a bone from the earth without doing thorough
				chemical analysis on every two meters of rock face nearby.<br>
				<list>
				<li><b>Take core samples</b> - Grab a rock core for every 4m^2.</li>
				<li><b>Clear around any potential finds</b> - Clear away ordinary rock, leaving your prizes reachable in a clearly marked area.</li>
				<li><b>Haul off excess rock</b> - It's easy for a dig to get cluttered, and a neat archaeologist is a successful archaeologist.</li>
				<li><b>Don't be afraid to be cautious</b> - It's slower sometimes, but the extra time will be worth the payoff when you find an Exolitic relic.</li>
				<li><b>Chemical analysis</b> - I won't go into detail here, but the labwork is essential to any successful extraction. Marshal your core samples, and
					send them off to the labcoated geniuses</li>
				</list><br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Excavate">Extracting your first find</a></h1>
				<list>
				<li><b>Scan the rock</b> - Use a depth scanner to determine the find's depth and clearance. DON'T FORGET THESE.</li>
				<li><b>Choose stasis field</b> - Chemical analysis on a core sample from the rock face will tell you which field is necessary to extract the find safely</li>
				<li><b>Setup field gen</b> - Bolt it down, choose the field, check the charge and activate it. If you forget it, you'll wish you hadn't when that priceless
					Uryom vase crumbles as it sees the light of day.</li>
				<li><b>FUNCTIONAL AND SAFE digging</b> - Dig into the rock until you've cleared away a depth equal to (the anomaly depth MINUS the clearance range). The find
					should come loose on it's own, but it will be in the midst of a chunk of rock. Use a welder or miniature excavation tool to clear away the excess.</li>
				<li><b>FANCY AND SPEEDY digging</b> - Dig into the rock until you've cleared away a depth equal to the anomaly depth, but without any of your strokes
					entering the clearance range.</li>
				<li><b>The Big Find</b> - Sometimes, you'll chance upon something big, both literally and figuratively. Giant statues and functioning remnants of Precursor
					technology are just as exciting, to the right buyers. If your digging leaves a large boulder behind, dig into it normally and see if anything's hidden
						inside.</li>

				<h1><a name="Analysis">Analysis progression</a></h1>
				Modern mass spectrometry requires constant attention from the diligant researcher in order to be successul. There are many different elements to juggle,
					and later chapters will delve into them. For the spectrometry assistant, the first thing you need to know is that the scanner wavelength is automatically
					calculated for you. Just tweak the settings and try to match it with the actual wavelength as closely as possible.<br>
				<br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Seal">Seal integrity</a></h1>
				In order to maintain sterile and environmentally static procedures, a special chamber is setup inside the spectrometer. It's protected by a proprietary vacuum seal
					produced by top tier industrial science. It will only last for a certain number of scans before failing outright, but it can be resealed through use of nanite paste.
					Unfortunately, it's susceptible to malforming under heat stress so exposing it to higher temperatures will cause it's operation life to drop significantly.<br>
				<br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Heat">Heat management</a></h1>
				The scanner relies on a gyro-rotational system that varies in speed and intensity. Over the course of an ordinary scan, the RPMs can change dramatically. Higher RPMs
					means greater heat generation, but is necessary for the ongoing continuation of the scan. To offset heat production, spectrometers have an inbuilt cooling system.
					Researchers can modify the flow rate of coolant to aid in dropping temperature as necessary, but are advised that frequent coolant replacements may be necessary
					depending on coolant purity. Water and substances such as cryoxadone are viable substitutes, but nowhere near as effective as pure coolant itself.<br>

				<h1><a name="Radiation">Ambient radiation</a></h1>
				Researchers are warned that while operational, mass spectrometers emit period bursts of radiation and are thus advised to wear protective gear. In the event of
					radiation spikes, there is also a special shield that can be lowered to block emissions. Lowering this, however, will have the effect of blocking the scanner
					so use it sparingly.<br>

				It's perhaps one of the most exciting times to be alive, with the recent breakthroughs in understanding and categorisation of things we may one day no longer call
				'anomalies,' but rather 'infrequent or rare occurrences of certain celestial weather or phenomena.' Perhaps a little more long winded, but no less eloquent all the
				same! Why, look at the strides we're making in piercing the walls of bluespace or our steadily improving ability to clarify and stabilise subspace emissions; it's
				certainly an exciting time to be alive. For the moment the Hydrolian hasn't seen two spatial anomalies alike but the day will come and it is soon, I can feel it.

				In today's high tech research fields, leaps and bounds are being made every day. Whether it's great strides forward in our understanding of the physical universe

				Well, when you're out there building the next gryo-whatsitron or isotope mobility thingummy, remember how the field of archaeology experienced a massive new rebirth

				<h1><a name="Anomalies">Modern attitude towards anomalies</a></h1>
				It's only when confronted with things we don't know, that we may push back our knowledge of the world around us. Nowhere is this more obvious than the
				vast and inscrutable mysterious of the cosmos that scholars from such august institutions as the Elysian Institute of the Sciences present
				formulas and hypotheses for every few decades.<br>
				<br>
				Using our vast telescopic array installations and deep space satellite networks, we are able to detect anomalous energy fields and formations in deep space,
				but are limited to those that are large enough to output energy that will stretch across light years worth of distance between stars.<br>
				<br>
				While some sectors (such as the Hydrolian Rift and Keppel's Run) are replete with inexplicable energetic activity and unique phenomena found nowhere else in
				the galaxy, the majority of space is dry, barren and cold - and if past experience has told us anything, it is that there are always more things we are
				unable to explain.<br>
				<br>
				Indeed, a great source of knowledge and technology has always been those who come before us, in the form of the multitudinous ancient alien precursors that
				have left scattered remnants of their great past all over settled (and unexplored) space.<br>
				<br>
				It is from xenoarchaeologists, high energy materials researchers and technology reconstruction authorities that we are able to theorise on the gifts these
				species have left behind, and in some cases even reverse engineer or rebuild the technology in question. My colleague Doctor Raymond Ward of the
				Tyrolian Institute on Titan has made great breakthroughs in a related field through his pioneering development of universally reflective materials capable
				of harvesting and 'bottling' up virtually any energy emissions yet encountered by spacefaring civilisations.<br>
				<br>
				And yet, there are some amongst us who do not see the benefits of those who have come before us - indeed, some among them profess the opinion that there
				is no species that could possibly match humanity in it's achievements and knowledge, or simply that employing non-human technology is dangerous and unethical.
				Folly, say I. If it is their desire to throw onto the wayside the greatest achievements <i>in the history of the galaxy</i>, simply for preferment of the
				greatest achievements <i>in the history of mankind</i>, then they have no business in the establishment of science.<br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Tri">Triangulating anomalous energy readings</a></h1>
				Strong energy emissions, when remaining constant from any one fixed location for millenia, can leave an 'imprint' or distinctive energy signature on other
				matter composites that are spatially fixed relative to the source.<br>
				<br>
				By taking samples of such 'fixed' matter, we can apply complex analytics such as the modified Fourier Transform Procedure to reverse engineer the path of the
				energy, and determine the approximate distance and direction that the energy source is, relative to the sample's point in space. Modern portable devices can do
				all this purely by taking readings of local radiation.<br>
				<br>
				A canny researcher can thusly analyse radiationat pre-chosen points strategically scattered around an area, and if there are any anomalous energy
				emissions in range of those points, combined the researcher can triangulate the source.<br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Synthetic">Harvesting and utilising anomalous energy signatures</a></h1>
				As mentioned in the forward, my colleague from the Tyrolian Institute on Saturn's moon of Titan, in the Sol System, Doctor Raymond Ward has made great strides
				in the area of harvesting and application of the energy emitted by anomalous phenomena from around the galaxy (although I profess I have not yet seen him
				venture further from his birthplace on Earth than the comfortable distance of the Sol Cis-Oort Satellite Sphere).<br>
				<br>
				By employing a patented semi-phased alloy with unique and fascinating bluespace interaction properties, Ward's contraption is able to 'harvest' energy, store
				it and redirect it later at will (with appropriate electronic mechanisms, of course). Although he professes to see or desire no commercial or material gain
				for the application and use of said energy once it is harvested, there are no doubt myriad ways we can come to benefit from such things beyond mere research,
				such as the reconstruction of torn cartiligenous tissue that a peculiar radiation from an amphibious species on Brachis IV was found to emit.<br>

				<br>
				<h1><a name="Forward">Forward: A replacement for cryosleep?</a></h1>
				The development of rudimentary cryofreezing in the 20th and 21st centuries was hailed as a crank science by some, but many early visionaries recognised the
				potential it had to change the way we approach so many fields, such as medicine, therapeutics and space travel. It was breakthroughs in the field in the 22nd and
				later centures that turned the procedure from science fiction to science fact, however. Since then, cryogenics has become a hallmark of modern science, and
				regarded as one of the great achievements of our era. As with all sciences however, they have their time and are superseded by newer technological miracles when
				it is over.<br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Development">The breakthrough</a></h1>
				It was in examining the effects of decellerated, blue-space high energy particles when transphased through bluespace that the effects where primarily noticed.
				Due to exigent properties of that dimension, transphasing those particles capable of existing in bluespace with high stability levels has the effect of bringing
				some of those effects into realspace. Examining the Hoffman emissions in particular, it was discovered that they exhibited a-entropic behaviour, and in what is
				now termed the 'Effete Hoffman Principle,' it was found that metastabilising the Hoffman radiation resulted in the effect being applied across other physical
				interactions, in particular forces and reactions.<br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Application">Applying this new principle</a></h1>
				When combined with an appropriate energy-effect replicate for cryogenics (slowing down biological activity, thus stabilising the organics), the effect is
				effectively identical to cryogenics, and while it consumes vastly more power and requires extremely complex equipment, it's (for all intents and purposes) superior
				to cryogenics, all that remains is to 'commercialise' the process by enabling cheaper development and mass production.<br>
				The Effete Hoffman Principle can be tweak-combined with other effects however, for different purposes. A division of PMC Research initially developed the application
				in prisons as a literal 'suspension field' where convincts are held immobile in the air, and the use quickly spread to numerous other areas.<br>
				<br>
				By examining the material resonance properties of certain strong waveforms when combined with Hoffman radiation, an effect was produced able to reverse energy
				transferral through matter, and to slow the effects of gravity. When combined with energy repulse technology, the triple effects compound themselves into a much
				stronger field, although all three componenets do slightly different things. High energy researchers assure me of the following key points:<br>
				<ol>
					<li>The energy repulsion factor provides a 'shell' capable of weak suspension.</li>
					<li>The Hoffman emissions nullify energy transferral and other kinetic activity, maintaining stability inside the field.</li>
					<li>The resonant waveform combines the effects of the above two points, and applies it magnified onto it's synched 'resonance' materials.</li>
				</ol>
				As an interesting aside, a carbon waveform was chosen for the field in prison suspension fields, due to it's resonance with organic matter.<br>
