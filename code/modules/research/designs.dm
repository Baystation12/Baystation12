/***************************************************************
**						Design Datums						  **
**	All the data for building stuff and tracking reliability. **
***************************************************************/
/*
For the materials datum, it assumes you need reagents unless specified otherwise. To designate a material that isn't a reagent,
you use one of the material IDs below. These are NOT ids in the usual sense (they aren't defined in the object or part of a datum),
they are simply references used as part of a "has materials?" type proc. They all start with a $ to denote that they aren't reagents.
The currently supporting non-reagent materials:
- $metal (/obj/item/stack/metal). One sheet = 3750 units.
- $glass (/obj/item/stack/glass). One sheet = 3750 units.
- $plasma (/obj/item/stack/plasma). One sheet = 3750 units.
- $silver (/obj/item/stack/silver). One sheet = 3750 units.
- $gold (/obj/item/stack/gold). One sheet = 3750 units.
- $uranium (/obj/item/stack/uranium). One sheet = 3750 units.
- $diamond (/obj/item/stack/diamond). One sheet = 3750 units.
- $clown (/obj/item/stack/clown). One sheet = 3750 units. ("Bananium")
(Insert new ones here)

Don't add new keyword/IDs if they are made from an existing one (such as rods which are made from metal). Only add raw materials.

Design Guidlines
- The reliability formula for all R&D built items is reliability_base (a fixed number) + total tech levels required to make it +
reliability_mod (starts at 0, gets improved through experimentation). Example: PACMAN generator. 79 base reliablity + 6 tech
(3 plasmatech, 3 powerstorage) + 0 (since it's completely new) = 85% reliability. Reliability is the chance it works CORRECTLY.
- When adding new designs, check rdreadme.dm to see what kind of things have already been made and where new stuff is needed.
- A single sheet of anything is 3750 units of material. Materials besides metal/glass require help from other jobs (mining for
other types of metals and chemistry for reagents).
- Add the AUTOLATHE tag to
