	As of byond 512, due to how broken preloading is, preload_rsc MUST be set to 1 at compile time if resource URLs are *not* in use,
	BUT you still want resource preloading enabled (from the server itself). If using resource URLs, it should be set to 0 and
	changed to a URL at runtime (see client_procs.dm for procs that do this automatically). More information about how goofy this broken setting works at
	http://www.byond.com/forum/post/1906517?page=2#comment23727144
