	When somebody clicks a link in game, this Topic is called first.
	It does the stuff in this proc and  then is redirected to the Topic() proc for the src=[0xWhatever]
	(if specified in the link). ie locate(hsrc).Topic()

	Such links can be spoofed.

	Because of this certain things MUST be considered whenever adding a Topic() for something:
		- Can it be fed harmful values which could cause runtimes?
		- Is the Topic call an admin-only thing?
		- If so, does it have checks to see if the person who called it (usr.client) is an admin?
		- Are the processes being called by Topic() particularly laggy?
		- If so, is there any protection against somebody spam-clicking a link?
	If you have any  questions about this stuff feel free to ask. ~Carn
