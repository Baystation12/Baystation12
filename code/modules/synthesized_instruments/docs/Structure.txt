This module uses 4 components:
Real instruments -- the physical manifestation of the instrument, the one that is placed in the world
Virtual instruments -- the definition of an instrument, that is, what samples it uses, name and category
Sound player -- used to apply modification to all sounds emitted. Represents the actual source of sound
Synthesized Song - just like /datum/song it's what parses and plays a melody
---
Real instruments inherit from either /obj/structure/synthesized_instrument (static musical instrument) or /obj/item/device/synthesized_instrument (handheld musical instrument)
---
Virtual instruments all inherit from /datum/instrument. 
Virtual instruments should follow this structure: /datum/instrument/category_name/instrument_name.

Refer to any file in ./instrument_data to see how it's done.
---
Sound player inherits from /obj/sound_player
---
For synthesized song only use /datum/synthesized_song
