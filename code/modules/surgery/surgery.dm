//INFO
//Check /mob/living/carbon/attackby for how surgery progresses.
//As of Feb 14 2013 it's in code/modules/mob/living/carbon/carbon.dm, line 448.
//Other important variables are var/list/surgeries (/mob/living) and var/list/internal_organs (/mob/living/carbon).
//Surgical procedures are initiated by attempt_initiate_surgery(), which is called by surgical drapes and bedsheets.


//TODO
//empty hand surgery steps, surgery steps with any item
//specific steps for some surgeries (fluff text)
//R&D researching new surgeries (especially for non-humans)
//surgeries (not steps) that can be initiated on any body part (corresponding with damage locations)
//more interesting failure options
//randomised complications
//more surgeries!
//add a generic proc to check if target location is unclothed
//add a probability modifier for the state of the surgeon- health, twitching, etc. blindness, god forbid.
//helper for converting a zone_sel.selecting to body part (for damage)
//combine hands/feet into the arms
