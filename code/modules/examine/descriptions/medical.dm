/obj/machinery/atmospherics/unary/cryo_cell
	description_info = "The cryogenic chamber, or 'cryo', treats most damage types, most notably genetic damage. It also stabilizes patients \
	in critical condition by placing them in stasis, so they can be treated at a later time.<br>\
	<br>\
	In order for it to work, it must be loaded with chemicals, and the temperature of the solution must reach a certain point. Additionally, it \
	requires a supply of pure oxygen, provided by canisters that are attached. The most commonly used chemicals in the chambers are Cryoxadone and \
	Clonexadone. Clonexadone is more effective in treating all damage, including Genetic damage, but is otherwise functionally identical.<br>\
	<br>\
	Activating the freezer nearby, and setting it to a temperature setting below 150, is recommended before operation! Further, any clothing the patient \
	is wearing that act as an insulator will reduce its effectiveness, and should be removed.<br>\
	<br>\
	Clicking the tube with a beaker full of chemicals in hand will place it in its storage to distribute when it is activated.<br>\

	Click your target with Grab intent, then click on the tube, with an empty hand, to place them in it. Click the tube again to open the menu. \
	Press the button on the menu to activate it. Once they have reached 100 health, right-click the cell and click 'Eject Occupant' to remove them. \
	Remember to turn it off, once you've finished, to save power and chemicals!"
