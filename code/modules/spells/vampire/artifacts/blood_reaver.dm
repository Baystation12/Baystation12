//Proof of concpet idea: Grand master vampire gets one of two reavers: The blood reaver and the void reaver. This is the former. Only two reavers may exist in the game at one time, but can be transferred between vampires by feeding off the corpse of another. This assumes total endgame, where all that remains are vampires to quarrel among themselves.
/*
The Blood Reaver, unlike its counterpart, is focused more on crowd control instead of pure mobility.
Blood reaver has five abilities -

Sanguine Censure
Spend all your blood, risking frenzy, in exchange for a togglable 'fury mode' until cancelled. Has a constant, though minor passive blood cost.

'Fury mode' causes all strikes with the blood reaver to draw the damage it does in usable blood, as well as giving the user the ability
to leap at the nearest human mob. Nigh useless against synths and other beings without haemoglobin. Give a yes/no prompt the first time it is activated.


Cadaverous Lacerations
Desc: "The telekinetic blade of the Reaver nicks my furthest opponent in several locations, allowing me to draw and solidify their blood to pull them to me.

What it says on the tin. Should this cost blood?

Infernal Sundering
Desc: "Upon slamming the serpentine blade of the Blood Reaver into an enemy, the force will blast their pathetic body into the floor, and beyond."
BLOWS A BITCH THROUGH THE FLOOR. Deals massive brute instead, if the turf below is a wall, or the floor is a reinforced floor. Has a blood  cost.

Kinetic Shackles
Desc: "Reinforcing the telekinetic power of the Reaver with a bit of honed technique, I am able to temporarily shackle my enemies in place.

Nightmare's Hammer
Desc: "Using the telekinetic power of the Reaver, I am able to grip an opponent from a short distance, and hoist them wherever I prefer them to be."
Throws a mob. Does not stop throwing them over a distance, instead only stopping until they hit something, dealing decent amounts of brute, not enough to break bones, but a lot of pain.
