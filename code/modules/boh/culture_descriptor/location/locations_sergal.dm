	 Primary sapient species that Tal hosts are the three races from Eltus species - Sergals, Agudners, and Nevreans.\
	 Tal's most of the wildlife consists of Talyxian creatures and a host of unclassified or undocumented species, such as a fish, insects, worms, mollusks, and plants inhabiting everywhere from urban or suburban areas to a virgin forest and deep wilderness.\
	 Those creatures are native to Tal and generally classified as 'Primitive creatures', and recognize as 'alien biomes' from Eltus races."
