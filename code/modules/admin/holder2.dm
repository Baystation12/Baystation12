checks if usr is an admin with at least ONE of the flags in rights_required. (Note, they don't need all the flags)
if rights_required == 0, then it simply checks if they are an admin.
if it doesn't return 1 and show_msg=1 it will prints a message explaining why the check has failed
generally it would be used like so:

proc/admin_proc()
	if(!check_rights(R_ADMIN)) return

NOTE: it checks usr! not src! So if you're checking somebody's rank in a proc which they did not call
you will have to do something like if(client.holder.rights & R_ADMIN) yourself.
