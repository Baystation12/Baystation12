Among these vessels there are three groups of which they hail. Fifth Fleet Special Group Alpha, Third Fleet Support Group Bravo, and the Fifth Fleet Carrier Group Alpha. At this time all vessels within ||VesselList.rpt |ERROR: UNABLE TO LOAD|| have been confirmed to have absconded from their duties.</p>

Vice Admiral Yamato Akito of the SFV Resolution has agreed to mobilize patrols within other systems near the core.</p>
<p><strong>...</strong></p>

<p><tt><tt><strong>FROM:</strong> Admiral Henry Lau, Observatory<br /><strong>TO:</strong> Expeditionary Corps Vessel #3, SEV Torch<br /><strong>CC:</strong> Flag Admiral Magny Khan, Commandant of the Expeditionary Corps<br /><strong>SUBJECT:</strong> Update to the SEV Torch<br /></tt></tt></p>
<hr />
<p>Good day, SEV Torch. For the purposes of reality this document can be disseminated to anyone within your retinue of Line Officers and support staff, but try to keep things secure, and need-to-know where applicable. And, please, most importantly, make sure this doesn't need to be scrubbed from the ship's systems again.</p>
<p>You'll pardon me for the colloquialisms, but things aren't in a particularly great state as it stands right now. The SEV Torch is at the center of a controversy in regards to what is happening within the governance right now, and doubly so within the Fleet. A lot of pressure is coming from the Senate and the Assembly both to put us in a tight spot.</p>
<p>It's been difficult for Admiral Khan to keep things running smoothly with other organizations due to this. And to do so, we've had to make some concessions in regards to how things are being ran for now. Particularly, the Fleet has to be placated rather heavily for us to continue operating in the way we are. For the time being this doesn't effect you, at least directly, and if this changes you will be informed via fax or direct report.</p>
<p>As always, we have staff on standby to answer your faxes and offer order clarification in the event it's required, and you should also remember to ask for clarifications&nbsp;<em>before&nbsp;</em>following orders you may view as strange, cruel or unusual. We are counting on you to be an example right now, do not let us down Torch.</p>
<p>Updates on the encroaching situation will be sent to you on a need-to-know basis with the approval of Admiral Khan. For the time being, continue operations as normal. Record the status of your bluespace drive regularly, report any fleet vessels that may contact you to us, and remember the oaths you all took. Avoid danger, but don't run away. Godspeed.</p>
