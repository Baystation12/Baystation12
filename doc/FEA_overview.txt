Involved datums
===============

/datum/gas_mixture
    code/FEA/FEA_gas_mixture.dm

    This is the backbone of the entire FEA system. It's the conceptual representation of both,
    "air" and "volume", and literally anything that can store air, including gas tanks you put
    on your back use this datum.

    Provides a lot of functionality, including such silly things like the equal gas equation,
    or thermal conductivity, but also useful stuff like gas equalization with other mixtures,
    or combustion(the stuff that makes air hot and causes fire).

/datum/air_group
    code/FEA/FEA_air_group.dm
    Responsible for unifying groups of tiles into one and treating them as one large tile.

/datum/controller/air_system
    code/FEA/FEA_system.dm
    Responsible for initializing air groups and performing the simulation calls.

/turf, /turf/simulated 
    code/FEA/FEA_tile.dm
    Offers a high-level interface for exchanging air. Provides individual per-tile basis
    simulation. Stores information about air pressure and direction.

/obj/effect/hotspot
    code/FEA/FEA_fire.dm
    In nearly all cases, this is an effect object which represent fire. This object is responsible
    for the fire effects itself(but doesn't generate temperature, this is done by a separate mechanism
    in gas_mixture).


Atmos simulation workflow
=========================

Initialization
--------------

- master controller creates air_system
- air_system tries to combine all tiles on the map into air_groups
  and stores the groups in a list. groups are built only from turfs
  that are directly connected to eachother, and not separated by doors,
  walls, windows, or other objects that block air.


Simulation Step
---------------
- master controller calls air_system.process
- air_system calls process_group() on the individual air_groups
- air_group checks if it's in group processing mode
- Case 1: Group processing
    - air_group gathers the tiles bordering itself
        - If the tile is itself in a group, do air_group <=> air_group exchange
        - If the tile is a turf, do air_group <=> turf exchange
        - If the tile is a space connection, invoke special code
    - Before doing the air exchange, air_group checks how much gas would be exchanged.
      If the amount exceeds a treshold, air_group suspends group processing.
- Case 2: No Group Processing
    - air_group calls process_cell on all turfs in the group
- Every N ticks, the air system checks all air_groups for whether they have stabilized
  enough to be combined into a group again.


Group processing
----------------

As can be seen above, group processing means that all the tiles in a group are treated as one uniform mass.
This way, all calculations involving the group are only done once per entity bordering it, which cuts down
on processing power quite neatly.

However, group processing is suspended when too much air is inserted into a tile at once. This means that
*whenever* anything large happens, the group is split up, and tiles are processed individually.
